@title Do I Have A Choice?
@draft

I <em>do</em> have a choice. And I'm not really that happy about it. What happens if I click that «Add This» button on your article? This appears:

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1958" title="addthis" src="http://www.nicollet.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/addthis.png" alt="addthis" width="515" height="729" />

There are so many choices here that they actually had to <strong>add a search box</strong> to find the choice that you're looking for. Of all the sharing options on this screen, I use Netvibes and LinkedIn, and have heard about LiveJournal, iGoogle and Hotmail.

But the real winner? This lets me share/bookmark the page using <em>HTML Validator</em>. Joy!
