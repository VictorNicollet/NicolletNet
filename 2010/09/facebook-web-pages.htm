If you're doing anything that involves dealing with many people, you <strong>need</strong> to have a web presence. It doesn't have to be a billion-dollar corporation or a trans-national association. My wedding will have a web presence because it involves several people and losing an online web site in your history or bookmarks is harder than losing a fancy piece of paper, and because a web page can provide so much more features than dead tree paste.For instance:

Where will the wedding be? ? link to <strong>Google Maps</strong> (though Alix prefers Mappy)

When will it be? ? click a link to add it to your <strong>Outlook / Google Calendar</strong>

How do I get there? ? see a list of hotels and train schedules

Who is coming? ? use the <strong>RSVP </strong>feature

This is turning into a wedding organization checklist, which isn't the point. The real question is, <strong>should I create a Facebook Page or a normal Web Page?</strong>
<h4>Advantages of Facebook Pages</h4>
<ol>
	<li>It's <strong>easy</strong>: you don't need any technical abilities to set up and maintain a Facebook page.</li>
	<li>It's <strong>free</strong> (as long as you don't buy ads).</li>
	<li>You get a clean and readable <strong>page layout</strong>, a <strong>discussion forum</strong>, a <strong>photo gallery</strong>, a simple <strong>web analytics suite</strong>, and a readily available <strong>Open Graph node</strong> (something people can <em>Like</em>)</li>
	<li>The wall of your page acts as a <strong>multimedia mini-blog</strong> with automatic <strong>subscription for Facebook users</strong> (when they Like your page, all your updates show up in their feed) and <strong>RSS subscription</strong> as well.</li>
	<li>People <strong>trust</strong> Facebook pages, because Facebook would not allow harmful or offensive pages</li>
</ol>
<h4>Advantages of Web Pages</h4>
<ol>
	<li>You can use any <strong>web domain</strong>. Not having your own domain name can sound unprofessional, and it can reduce your Google Ranking.</li>
	<li>You can create a web page <strong>for anything</strong>, without being limited by the Facebook terms of use or the possibility of Facebook simply wiping out your page from existence on a whim.</li>
	<li>You can have a <strong>real blog</strong>, with updates of a meaningful size.</li>
	<li>You <strong>control</strong> your web page, which lets you include any special features that Facebook does not allow (a store locator, files to be downloaded, dynamic data, restricted areas, multiple languages, a link to a twitter account).</li>
	<li>People <strong>explore</strong> web sites: they come in non-standard formats with non-standard information, so there's curiosity involved.</li>
</ol>
So ultimately, it's a matter of independence versus commodity. If you don't need the benefits or social standing of having a standalone Web Page, go for a Facebook Page instead. Otherwise, be independent, but be prepared to pay the cost (in time and money).

On the long term, having a Facebook Page ultimately serves a different purpose from your Web Page, so you should strive to have both.
