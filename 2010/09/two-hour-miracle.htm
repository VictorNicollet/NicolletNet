Yesterday evening, I worked on the <a href="http://www.alix-marcorelles.fr/" target="_blank">professional website of Alix Marcorelles</a>. My mission was to create an online version of her résumé, with a professional feel and the appropriate SEO voodoo, based on a high-resolution picture of her and the <a href="http://www.alix-marcorelles.fr/AlixMarcorelles-cv.pdf" target="_blank">PDF version of her resumé</a>.

Fast Quiz: how long do you think it would take your usual IT contractors to achieve the exact same result, if you gave them a picture of that page and the money to buy the domain name and the hosting? I suspect your answer will be anywhere between one day and one week, depending on how competent they are and how much overhead there is.
<h4>Two Hours</h4>
The page you see there is the result of only two hours of work, including the boring parts about buying the domain and uploading the files to the host. This is the <strong>Two Hour Miracle</strong>: someone creates in a very short time something that would take most of your usual contractors at least one day to get right, <em>even if you specified every single detail</em>.

I do not wish to imply here that I am the fastest web designer in the world. In fact, I suspect that I am below average. What I say is that I am experienced enough with that craft to be aware of my own strengths and weaknesses, and since I only had two hours available to set up that website, I went for a design that was the most adequate for my skill set.

For instance, the regular three-column layout I used is based on the <a href="http://www.blueprintcss.org/" target="_blank">Blueprint CSS framework</a>. It's a basic out-of-the-box structure that takes me about five minutes to set up appropriately (and that's including the time to download and install the framework). Without the framework, the same 4-4-3 column layout would take up to an hour to design, implement and test, and would probably involve some math to get right.

The icons I used were from the <a href="http://www.famfamfam.com/lab/icons/silk/" target="_blank">FamFamFam Silk</a> icon set, because that's an icon set I am deeply familiar with. I immediately know whether there's a «cell phone» icon in the pack, or what icon I could use to represent «geographical location» or «Microsoft Office» because I know them all. And I'm familiar with the «list of elements with an icon to the left» pattern, so that designing the right-hand side took me ten minutes (five of which were spent looking for a LinkedIn icon). Without intimate knowledge of an icon pack, the hunt for those icons could have taken hours.
<h4>Dispelling The Miracle</h4>
I often get to work with people who have seen the Two Hour Miracle happen for someone else, or even on another of their own projects, and then ask me to do the exact same thing for them, with only a few minor modifications.

Their modifications usually involve changing the page layout so that it does not fit within the out-of-the-box Blueprint model, which turns a five-minute hack into a two-hour design battle against the dark forces of Internet Explorer. They also involve some icons that don't exist in FamFamFam at all, such as 32×32 icons, so I have to hunt these down for a few hours as well. And they want to see what it looks like <em>before </em>it goes online, so I have to delay the upload until I get a green light from them. Last but not least, instead of a one-sentence mission statement, they have two pages of «<em>minor details</em>» that I need to read before I can start.

And now, I have become the average IT contractor who needs two days to achieve something that, to the naked eye, looks strikingly similar to the Two Hour Miracle.

What allowed me to accomplish a Two Hour Miracle was the unfettered freedom to cut my own path towards the objective, to use the tools that let me achieve a reasonable level of quality at surprising speeds. The lack of detailed specifications and micro-management helped me get good results faster.
<h4>Assembling The Miracle Workers</h4>
How do you turn your team or contractor into miracle workers? Steer away from the classic approach to technical design: <em>I decide on the features and ask the engineers how long it takes and how much it costs</em>. Instead, set some high-level objectives, set a limit on the time and money available, <em>and ask the engineers what they can do</em>.  This change of perspective leaves a lot of design work to the engineers, which means you need to select people who can work this way, and treat them in a way that helps them instead of acting like an obstacle.
<ol>
	<li><strong>Find people who share your sense of quality</strong>. If you want miracles to happen, you cannot afford to be micromanaging your own sense of quality down their throats. You need people you can trust with designing on their own a solution that matches your unspoken requirements. This means they can be trusted (their responsibility: be up to the task) and that you trust them (your responsibility: let go of the details, judge them on the overall quality of their work).</li>
	<li><strong>Find people who can think ahead</strong>. Two hours of work, no matter how miraculous, are worth nothing if they need to be thrown away to take into account a critical requirement. You need people who can plan for most contingencies through experience or natural paranoia, and see how the greater picture of your project fits in with their current objectives. This means they can plan their work (their responsibility: foresee any problems and create a solid implementation plan) and that you let them plan (your responsibility: let them know ahead of time of any critical requirements you have).</li>
	<li><strong>Explain why you need something, not how it should work</strong>. You might be convinced that your software needs a «Really Delete?» question, but your objective is to prevent data loss through accidental deletion, and your team knows that the application model or web framework supports the superior «<a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/neveruseawarning/" target="_blank">Deleted. Cancel?</a>» alternate solution to that problem at a lower cost. State your objective, and trust them with finding an appropriate solution.</li>
	<li><strong>Provide clear, immediate and non-aggressive feedback</strong>. When people get unspecified things wrong, do not take it as a sign of their incompetence or malice. They can't read your mind and probably have their own idea of what quality looks like. Feedback is necessary to help them adjust to your ideas. Also, remain available at all times for questions—if someone needs an answer from you to get to work on their two hour miracle, don't delay them by six hours.</li>
	<li><strong>Allow time for experimentation</strong>. Working at a very high speed relies on only using what you are already very familiar with, to avoid bad surprises. Not only can this get boring after a while (trust me, you don't want your team to be bored), but it also means your team does not get to improve their skills with different technologies or implementation strategies. Accept that some time will be wasting chasing technical red herrings, and let your team regularly create prototypes and proofs of concept.</li>
</ol>
While this may sound like it only applies to software design, it doesn't. Every creative, skill-based job out there can have Two Hour Miracles (and the above list is pretty much agnostic in this regard). For instance, here's a quote from a <a href="http://blog.asmartbear.com/how-to-get-quality-freelance-graphics-design-work-on-a-budget.html" target="_blank">short piece by Jason Cohen</a> about finding a graphic designer:
<blockquote>The most important qualification is whether you like their prior work. I cannot stress this enough: <strong>Designers don't morph their style to match yours; they don't deviate from their own style.</strong>

If they make slick, glossy, mocha-latte-modern-glassy stuff, you'd  better like that. If they make crunchy, green, friendly, round-rectangle  stuff, you'd better like that.</blockquote>
This is basically the same thing: if you ask them for something that's not part of their Two Hour Miracle skill set, don't expect anything done in the short time.

See what I mean?

To the people who have to deal with IT out there : if you agree with the above, would you consider sharing it around on Facebook or Twitter? I'd rather have this idea spread as much as possible :)
