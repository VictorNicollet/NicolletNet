@title We Don't Care About Your Prose
@draft

So there you are, Mr Blog Author. Or Ms (I'm not very good at guessing genders over the Internet). Through devious plans and clever hacks and selling your body on the e-streets you've achieved what seemed impossible at first: brand new pairs of eyeballs hitting pages on your web site every day. There you are, rubbing your hands and cackling like an evil maniac in front of your Google Analytics benchmark, wondering what to do next.

«<em>What you should do,</em>» shouts just about every blog expert, «<em>is let people subscribe in a variety of ways: RSS, e-mail, twitter...</em>»

This is right. But it's too soon. What you have now is a reader who has only read one article on your blog. Before they add you to their RSS aggregator or give you permission to send them e-mail updates or commit to anything, they will want to know whether that article they just read is typical of your abilities as an author, or if you just managed to get lucky.

So, they will click on another link, desperately trying to read another article on your blog. <strong>The second article anyone reads on your blog is the most important article they will ever read</strong>.

Silly people all around the world think it's the first article that matters. <em>Bovine feces</em>, I say. You have absolutely no control over what the first article will be—this is up to the people who link to your web site. So, if a popular twitter user mentions your article about a shrimp on a treadmill to the tune of Benny Hill, this means a crowd will be reading that article as a first article. Besides writing great articles all the time, the only thing you can do is find out what articles people are being linked to, and improve the format of those articles (do not change their text: it's dishonest and you <em>will</em> be called on it).

You do have control over what the second article is. What people can do when they're done reading an article, ranked from potentially bestest to potentially worstest:
<ul>
	<li>Pick a link in the «related posts» list <em>(you have one, right?)</em></li>
	<li>Follow a link in the «recommended reading» list <em>(you have one, right?)</em></li>
	<li>Click on a comment in the «recent comments» list <em>(you have one, right?)</em></li>
	<li>Use the «next» and «previous» links</li>
	<li>Follow a link in the «recent posts» list</li>
	<li>Click on the «home» link to navigate to the latest blog post</li>
	<li>Go for the archives</li>
</ul>
Which one they will pick depends on whether you have these links and where they are in the layout. It's in your best interest to have all of the links at the top of the list, and point them to the best articles you can find on your blog (I recently did this, using the number of Facebook Likes to pick them). And the real trick is this: <strong>people don't care about your prose, what they love or hate is your ideas and your content</strong>. Unless you're writing about prose, of course.

If people are looking for a second article to read, it means they enjoyed the ideas and content they found in the first article they read, and they need to read more.

Your «related posts» should point to similar content. Your «recommended reading» should match the theme of your blog <em>(you have one, right?)</em>.

<strong>Always repeat yourself on your blog, in as many posts as you can</strong>. You write the damn thing, of course it feels repetitive to you. But someone who just discovered it and is intrigued by your ideas? They just cannot. Have. Enough. They want more and you should give them more!
