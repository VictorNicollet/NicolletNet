There are many different ways in which an individual might belong to a community. Some of them are passive while others are active, some of them chose to belong there while others simply never chose to leave, some of them care about the community while others only care about whatever the community stands for. To anyone who has to work with communities, an overview of the various profiles of community members is essential.
<h4><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mitosettembremusica/2839965900/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2045" title="2839965900_c23f818c97_z" src="http://www.nicollet.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/2839965900_c23f818c97_z.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="427" /></a></h4>
<h4>1. The Passionate</h4>
He's the meat and potatoes of your community, passionate about its final purpose and willing to share that passion with others. In a Neighborhood Association, these are people passionate about living there and willing to improve everything they can. In a Board Game Club, they are the people who love playing board games and always try to get their friends to play with them.

Cater to the Passionate, for they have the perfect balance of doing and sharing—if either is missing, your community will soon turn into chaos or silence. Their main interest in joining the community is finding like-minded people to discuss their shared passion, so that as long as you keep a fair proportion of  passionate members, they will be happy enough to stay.
<h4>2. The Socialites</h4>
Above all, the Socialite enjoys being part of social circles. The purpose of the community is just an excuse for meeting other people that have something in common with you. She joins a Poetry club because they she to meet people and Poetry is a good topic to <em>start</em> a discussion—but she will feel no obligation to stay on topic.

The Socialite is both an asset and a time bomb. Her tendency to network with everyone is an excellent way of keep conversations going, help new members integrate with the group quickly, and connecting to people outside your community for help or for finding new members. However, unless properly channeled to a dedicated «off topic» time or place (a forum, a dinner), she might bore people who joined the community out of passion.
<h4>3. The Devoted</h4>
Every community needs people to work on the bloody details of making it work—when everyone else is having fun, these people meet and toil and work so that the sessions happen on time and the new members are given all the useful information and the web site is online and there's chocolate cookies and fresh lemonade waiting for everyone after the training session.

It is essential to find any new members that might turn into Devoted, to quickly grant them responsibilities that will help channel their energy. But be careful: people in positions of responsibility within a community have the power to change it. Some of the Devoted often have strong ideas about how the community should work, and such things are best discussed beforehand.
<h4>4. The Obsessed</h4>
Just like the Passionate, the Obsessed are madly in love with the purpose of the community, but they do not share it with others because of their timidity or lack of interest in human communication. In solo activities, such as Computer Programming, the Obsessed just keep to themselves (sometimes emerging from their cave to rant on a discussion board or join a club «to see what it's like») but team activities, such as board games or sports, force them to join a group so that they can engage in their passion.

The Obsessed don't care about <em>discussing</em> their passion, they just wish to act. They're a nice bunch to have around, but too many of them can turn any community into a quiet wasteland and turn off new members.
<h4>5. The Clueless</h4>
The Clueless join a gym because their wife asked them to. They join a church group because they parents asked them to. They join a knitting club because they're curious, but that curiosity fades after a few days. These are people who do not care about where they are, what they are doing or who they are doing it with. They come to one session in three and you couldn't find their phone number even if your life depended on it.

Most of the time, the Clueless are members who joined only recently, and don't really care about the community. Find them quickly, keep an eye on them, and let them vanish on their own.
<h4>6. The Role Models</h4>
When a member is exceedingly charismatic or skilled (and not completely obnoxious about it), other members will look up to her with respect and admiration. They are usually older members, who have been with the community for a while and are known to everyone. This implies that the community is old and large enough to support them, which is often a good sign that it's in good health; role models may leave, but they sometimes come back and are remembered by those who have become the new elders.

Having Role Models is a very good thing, because they give members a new reason for being part of the community: staying near the role model. If you have a few admirable players in a sports team, the other team members will enjoy their presence as much as they enjoy the game. Cater to the Role Models, and prevent them from becoming obnoxious about their superiority.
<h4>7. The Moderators</h4>
Some members are recognized by others to be wise, honest, independent and beyond reproach. This gives them the authority and leverage to moderate any issues that might come up between the other members, and teach any new members the lessons they need to be accepted in the group.

In medium-sized communities, moderators are the key to the continued stability of the community. In large-sized communities, their natural authority vanished because there are too many members for a natural consensus to exist on their status. In these cases, it becomes necessary to supplement their natural authority with an official title—but be wary of the risks: an official title does not grant legitimacy in the same way that natural authority does
