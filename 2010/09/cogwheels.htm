Are you looking for a motivational speech or a way to lift your spirits? Then go away. This stuff is depressing when you think about it for too long.

Still here? God, you must <em>enjoy</em> being depressed...

Read, <a href="http://www.econlib.org/library/Essays/rdPncl1.html" target="_blank">I, Pencil</a>, narrated by a pencil describing its genealogy:
<blockquote>I, Pencil, simple though I appear to be, merit your wonder and awe, a  claim I shall attempt to prove.  In fact, if you can understand me—no,  that's too much to ask of anyone—if you can become aware of the  miraculousness which I symbolize, you can help save the freedom mankind  is so unhappily losing.  I have a profound lesson to teach.  And I can  teach this lesson better than can an automobile or an airplane or a  mechanical dishwasher because—well, because I am seemingly so simple.

Simple? Yet, <em>not a single person on the face of this earth knows how to make me.</em> This sounds fantastic, doesn't it? Especially when it is realized that  there are about one and one-half billion of my kind produced in the  U.S.A.  each year.</blockquote>
<h3 style="clear: both;">The Need For Infrastructure</h3>
The ideas presented in the essay are fairly simple: creating a pencil requires several workers to use tools upon base materials (wood, metal, graphite, rubber). These materials and tools themselves had to be obtained by more workers using more tools and materials (a logger needs a saw to cut down the trees that will provide the wood for the pencil), and so on up the stream of industrial capacity.

Looking at things from the other side: assume that you have the detailed plans for every single tool and machine and substance involved in creating a standard 1950 pencil, and tens of thousands of intelligent, skilled and motivated workers, and we send you all back in time to 30,000 BC. How long do you think it would take before you could produce a single pencil? How much longer before you could produce them on an industrial scale?

I know I promised never to quote video games again, but this quote from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sid_Meier%27s_Alpha_Centauri#Characters" target="_blank">Chairman Sheng-ji Yang</a> is so appropriate that it would be a crime not to use it:
<blockquote>Technological advance is an inherently  iterative process. One does not simply take sand from the beach and  produce a Dataprobe. We use crude tools to fashion better tools, and  then our better tools to fashion more precise tools, and so on. Each  minor refinement is a step in the process, and all of the steps must be  taken.</blockquote>
And that's why building a colony on Mars (<a href="http://www.ironsky.net/site/film/about/" target="_blank">or the moon</a>) is so difficult: you have to ship the entire infrastructure from Earth before you can build anything meaningful <em>in situ</em>.
<h3>You're just like Everyone Else</h3>
Where do you stand in the grand scheme of things? The complexity of everyday things means that no matter what you do, you're a cog in a huge post-industrial machine. Even if you're the CEO of a huge corporation, you're just a cog that makes sure all the other cogs work together. What kind of cog are you exactly?

The general consensus is that working for a large corporation lets you feel like a very small cog in a very large machine, and that is a quite horrible feeling.

I disagree.

The <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">little cogs</span> employees of a large corporation may be frustrated at the small scope of their daily activities, but they still have hopes of being greater. They remain convinced that somewhere out there, some people are not just small pieces of a soulless machine, and they can grow up to be just like them.

This is a hope that I wish to annihilate.

The problem isn't that there are large corporations. The problem is that <strong>our technological level prevents any single person of accomplishing anything significant on their own</strong>, unless your definition of «significant» <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6YyWi4eQCI" target="_blank">predates our industrial society</a>.

Some people create web start-ups in the deluded hope of being self-sufficient and doing something great alone or as a small team. Yet, even if they succeed, they merely add a tiny speck of additional value to a vast heap of existing infrastructure—server-side software, web browsers, server hosting, server hardware, online payment systems, banks, internet backbones and service providers...

<strong>The added value of a start-up is, by definition, to leverage existing resources in a clever way</strong>, because the founding team does not have the time to create a significant amount of new resources. That's why we hear about «founders» (was there when it began) and «owners» (put money into it) and «authors» (provided all the high-level intellectual work) of successful projects, but seldom hear about «makers»

When you create a new company, you don't stop being a cog in the machine. You just start being a cog in a cleverly unexpected and deviously useful place in the machine. Don't let it go to your head—by going where no piece of the puzzle ever went before, it's your responsibility to fit in with the pieces around, which is a lot harder than letting other people find the right place for you.

And a lot more exciting, too.
