@title The Outstanding Economy

Not so long ago, this world was a world where everyone died within miles of the place they were born.<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/prokudin-gorsky/3280194348/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2052" title="peasant" src="http://www.nicollet.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/peasant.png" alt="" width="640" height="560" /></a>

If you wanted to have dinner, you could eat stale bread at home, or you could eat stale bread at a friend's home, or you could eat somewhat less stale bread at the village inn or tavern. If you wanted to eat something really outstanding, you would go to a large city and spend what probably amounted to your life's savings to eat a meal by a top chef. And you would be happy because it had <em>meat</em> in it. And <em>spices</em>. Then, the industrial revolution happened, and its  main accomplishment was that it  turned masses of people living in the country with access to plain, bland commodities into masses of people living in the cities with access to plain, bland commodities. It also had a very interesting side-effect: it sparked a century-long downward trend in transportation costs.

In <strong>1610</strong>, even the richest merchant in Western Europe could not get their hands on a plain mango, because mangoes only grew in the east indies and were months away by ship or caravan. Until the advent of refrigeration, most of the western world knew of mangoes only in their pickled form (<a href="http://www2.journalnow.com/news/opinion/2010/sep/05/relative-obscurity-variations-of-antigodlin-grow-ar-395878/" target="_blank">this led to the apparition of «to mango» meaning «to pickle» in some parts of the US</a>).

In <strong>2010</strong>, advances in refrigeration technology (fruit last longer), air travel (fruit travels faster) and cultivar development (the main cultivar of mangoes, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tommy_Atkins_%28mango%29" target="_blank">Tommy Atkins</a>, was picked because it provides the longest shelf life) mean that everyone in the western hemisphere can buy a fresh mango for the equivalent of ten minutes of work at the average wage.

On a local scale, inhabitants of major cities have hundreds of restaurants available to them for dinner, conveniently placed within an hour of their home by car or public transportation.

And of course, using the internet, anyone has access to any piece of information available online, <em>and</em> can buy <a href="http://www.etsy.com/shop/SteampunkCouture" target="_blank">unique hand-crafted pieces</a> from an equally anonymous person on another continent.
<h4>Too Many Choices</h4>
When you only had access to a handful of options, you could become knowledgeable about each one. You could know how good was the food at every restaurant in town, because there were only five. You could have an opinion on <em>everything</em>, and if you didn't, <em>you could ask your friends</em>, which is how reputations spread.

As the number of options increased, the reputation system could not follow because there are too many alternatives for any individual or tight social group to handle. This led first to the apparition of <strong>reviews</strong> (a trusted third party specializes in having an opinion on everything, and shares it with everyone), but the number of product categories has increased (meaning you now need a reviewer reviewer to determine whom you can trust) and they now differ on several variables (weight, battery life, size of the app store, price...).

So, we end up subject to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Availability_heuristic" target="_blank"><strong>availability heuristic</strong></a> (people only remember and discuss exceptionally good and exceptionally bad things) and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satisficing" target="_blank"><strong>satisficing</strong></a> (people will settle on the first thing that's not too horrible).

There are two obvious strategies one could follow from here. One is the classic approach to marketing, which you probably experienced on a daily basis for decades: create something that isn't exceptionally bad (so it isn't knocked out by the availability heuristic), advertise the hell out of it so that it's the first thing people try (and settle on it through satisficing), and watch the cash come in. If you can set up a subscription-based system with lock-in, that's even better. This is a great strategy for conquering a new market, but it's extremely inefficient at stealing market share on existing markets.

The other strategy relies on creating an outstanding product—something that is so exceptionally good, the availability heuristic will kick in and customers won't even remember there were any competing products in the first place. While this strategy can be used for conquering new markets, the classic approach is cheaper because it can afford using a cheaper product. On the other hand, the only way to steal market share is to create something that is obviously and undoubtedly better than the alternatives.

So, it's a matter of <strong>outstanding</strong> vs. <strong>satisficing</strong>. What side are you on?
