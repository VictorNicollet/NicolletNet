Drug companies spend most of their marketing on doctors, even though patients are their primary source of income. The reason for this is that whenever patients have an issue that could be solved by a drug, they ask a doctor for advice (and, in many situations, drugs cannot be obtained without medical approval).

Makers of large corporate software set up partnerships with smaller developer shops: this increases the chances that when a client asks any contractor for a solution, that contractor will suggest the large corporate software product because that's what they are most familiar with. This is a lot of money spent on advertising, public relations and technical support when the actual source of income is the final client, not the developer shop.

The best way to advertise your product is to have smart, honest and influential people suggest it to others. The only way to have them do that is to create a great product and <em>help them notice</em> how great it is. You cannot <em>buy</em> or <em>advertise</em> your way into being sincerely advised to potential customers: honest people won't do it for the money and smart people will find out that it isn't great.
