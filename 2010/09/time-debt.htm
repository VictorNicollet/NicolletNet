  Debt is a method for transforming money you will earn later into
  money you can spend today. As such, not only does it reduce the
  amount of money you will be able to spend later (because you will be
  busy paying back your debt) but it also restricts your freedom to
  reduce your spending drastically should a life-changing event happen
  (losing your job and moving back with your parents).
</p>

<p>
  I won't go deeper into details
  - <a href="http://www.thesimpledollar.com/" target="_blank">the
  simple dollar</a> is a great blog that can tell you more about debt
  and money than I ever will, so just go and read it.
</p>

<p>
  Today, I want to talk about another kind of debt - <em>time debt</em>.
</p>

<p>
  Time debt happens whenever you transform time you have later into
  time you have now. If you don't spend the time to pick up your
  package from the post office today, you'll have to spend that time
  in the near future. Accumulating time debt could happen because you
  waste time on futile things (such as sitting in front of the
  television watching shows that you don't really care about), or it
  could happen for perfectly reasonable reasons: start-up founders are
  constantly in time debt, because there's so much they have to do to
  get their product out to market and find customers that
  non-profitable activities are often delayed months at a time.
</p>

<p>
  Despite the popular saying, time is not money: there are a few key
  differences between time debt and money debt that you need to take
  into account.
</p>

<h3>1. There is no inflation.</h3>

<p>
  Not only does inflation mean the value of money decreases (you used
  to buy a Foobar for $1, now you need $1.20) and thus makes money
  debt easier to pay back, but the revenue of individuals also tends
  to increase when they get raises or change jobs. In fact, taking on
  $10,000 in debt to start a new company that earns you $100,000 in
  the first two years is one of the ways you can leverage debt to
  improve your revenue and automatically make your debt easier to pay
  back.
</p>

<p>
  You will have 24 hours to spend every day for the rest of your life,
  and a lot of that is eaten up by sleep and natural urges. On the
  long term, having kids and growing older result in less time every
  day.
</p>

<p>
  The only situation where &laquo;&nbsp;<em>I'll have the time to do it
  tomorrow</em>&nbsp;&raquo; is a valid excuse is when you're expecting a
  significant deadline to blow over. If you're leaving your day job or
  your children are moving out or your very important paper due on
  Monday is done, then you can expect to have some free time. But even
  then, never underestimate your standing debt: all that free time is
  seldom enough to get all those delayed and postponed things done.
</p>

<h3>2. There is no refinancing.</h3>

<p>
  Refinancing happens because you just can't pay $4000 a month on a
  $3000 paycheck, so a refinancing company comes around and pays those
  $4000 a month for you, and you pay them $2500 a month for twice as
  long. That's because money debt does not have solid deadlines
  &mdash; its deadlines are liquid, because they can be paid for using
  more debt (which is what refinancing is).
</p>

<p>
  By contrast, you can't decide to work 40 hours <em>today</em> by
  using your free time for the entire next week. If you have a
  deadline that requires 40 hours of work and you only have 24 hours
  left, you're in trouble. Your only solution is to move the deadline
  &mdash; the equivalent of missing a payment.
</p>

<p>
  As a consequence, be extremely wary of looming deadlines involving
  your time debt. Try to get these out of the way as soon as possible
  (keeping only those actions without a deadline on your to-do list),
  and when you do delay them, make sure they are small enough items to
  fit within your time buffer (that amount of time you can use in an
  emergency by giving up on sleep and leisure), such as paying bills
  or replying to mail.
</p>

<h3>3. There's no price tag.</h3>

<p>
  One of the easiest things about money debt is that there's an
  explicit price tag on almost everything you buy. When you shop for a
  $900 laptop, you know it's going to cost you exactly $900 (because
  that's what the order confirmation page says), so you can accurately
  fit it into your budget (for instance, you could decide to amortize
  it over three months by decreasing your daily
  &laquo;&nbsp;free&nbsp;&raquo; budget by $10 &mdash; or use a credit
  card and decrease your daily &laquo;&nbsp;free&nbsp;&raquo; budget
  by $11, but that's another story).
</p>

<p>
  There's no price tag for activities. All you can do is estimate, and
  that estimation is seldom accurate beyond the ten-minute threshold
  for simple activities. Do you know long it takes to pick up some
  groceries? To cash a check? To prepare that cake you promised you'd
  bring to church on Sunday?
</p>

<p>
  Our inability to accurately estimate the time cost of activities
  means it's necessary to keep a safe buffer of time every day, just
  in case an important activity just bursts.
</p>

<h3>4. There are dependencies.</h3>

<p>
  With money, there are usually no dependencies or constraints in the
  order in which you pay for things. If you need to bake a chocolate
  cake, you can buy flour first or you can buy chocolate first, or you
  can buy both at the same time. In terms of time, you need to spend
  time buying flour and chocolate <em>before</em> you can spend time
  preparing the mix and putting it in the oven.
</p>

<p>
  Quite often, in complex activities, we estimate the time fairly
  accurately (I need ten minutes to prepare the mix and put it in the
  oven) but fail to take into account the dependencies because these
  only surface when you actually start planning the activity in
  detail. So, your ten-minute baking spree suddenly requires a
  half-hour grocery trip.
</p>

<h3>5. There are massive economies of scale</h3>

<p>
  Modern industrialized society has already extracted economies of
  scale from everything. If you buy twenty packs of soap instead of
  one pack, your per-unit economies are not very impressive &mdash;
  you probably won't even get a 50% price reduction.
</p>

<p>
  On the other hand, driving out once to buy twenty packs is
  significantly shorter than driving out twenty times. As an
  individual, you cannot benefit from industrial-scale infrastructure:
  even if you wanted to, there's no way for you to open one thousand
  letters to dilute the cost of finding the letter opener
  because <em>you do not receive that many letters</em>. The best you
  can do is buffer tasks that benefit from being done together: make a
  shopping list in advance to optimize the trip to the store and buy
  gasoline while you're there, keep your non-critical mail around for
  a week before you sort through it on Sunday afternoon, cook one meal
  that lasts a few days...
</p>

<h3>6. There are no savings</h3>

<p>
  If you don't spend any money today, it just sticks around. In fact,
  if you only spend a little, you will accumulate savings that can be
  used to buy (part of) a house, or a new car, or a computer, or your
  wedding, or your kid's college tuition, or whatever.
</p>

<p>
  That hour you spent on the train today? You will <em>never</em> get
  it back. Every second of your time that you don't spend doing
  something is wasted
  forever. <a href="http://abstrusegoose.com/51">And you only have so
  much time on this earth</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Unused time lends itself to reuse, especially with modern
  technology. That hour on the train could be spent eating, sleeping
  or playing (so that you'll have more free time when you're somewhere
  else), catching up with an old friend over the phone, working on a
  project (even as small as a blog post) or organizing your
  calendar...
</p>

<p>
  What are your considerations when saving time? Do you work with a
  time budget like you would work with a money budget? Do you have too
  much free time, or are you constantly running late?
