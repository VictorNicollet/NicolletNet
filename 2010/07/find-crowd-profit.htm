The latest buzzworthy topic around these parts is Paul, who correctly predicted the winner of eight matches in the 2010 Soccer World Cup. Also, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_the_Octopus" target="_blank">Paul is an octopus</a>. From Germany.

There's an approximately 0.4% probability of guessing all eight winners, assuming that the result of a match is equivalent to a coin flip (which, given that Paul probably doesn't read the sports pages, is an acceptable assumption). Of course, if there are tens of thousands of loonies around the world that try to predict World Cup results with crazy methods, then one of them is bound to get eight guesses right, and get the media attention.

The difference: Paul's popularity increased over time. Every time the octopus predicted a new winner, more and more people would be watching to see if that prediction was correct. So, there were hundreds and thousands of eyeballs who would hear that Argentina was to be defeated by Germany, then see the defeat happen with their own eyes, and remember the prediction. This is a lot more powerful than hearing about the predictions <em>after</em> they came true.

You can grab my attention by having an outstanding track record or a remarkable aspect to your product or persona. If my friends or trusted media outlets mention you, maybe I should be checking out your product or service or blog or tweeter feed. <strong>But to turn me into an active sneezer, you need me to experience how great you are.</strong> I need to see it happen!

When you manage to attract a truckload of fresh eyeballs, make sure your secret weapon is ready. Show them the fireworks. Have them go Oooh! and Aaah! <strong>Every time you attract someone to your website or product, you implicitly promise them that you have something very interesting to show them.</strong>

The last thing you want is for those people to see how <em>mundane</em>, how <em>boring</em> you really are. Keep your finger on that red button. And on <a href="http://www.nicollet.net/feed">my feed subscription button</a>, too.
