I have a fascination with flamethrowers. I'm lazy and I love fire, so anything that can let me burn things without having to stand up will get two thumbs up from me. One of the nice things about World War II is that they actually used flamethrowers on the battlefield.

Remember, back in the 1940s. Guns were scary because you <em>knew</em> they could kill you. Your brain is telling you that people die because of guns, so you're scared. Artillery and mines are about the same, except for the russian roulette aspect: you <em>know</em> you can be blown to shreds, but that's your brain talking.

But a flamethrower? You're scared because you <em>see</em> that it can kill you. It's your animal instincts. Animals are not afraid of guns, but they are afraid of flamethrowers. Nothing spells death like a fiery orange cloud.
<h4>"Yes, you love flamethrowers. Now get to the point"</h4>
The point. Right. What did flamethrowers actually not do in World War II ?

Work.

They didn't work. They're big, scary, macho killing machines, shinier than an iPhone 4 on your birthday, and they just didn't work.

Turns out, they have a shorter range than almost every single gun in existence, and they look like giant flashing "shoot me from a distance" signs whenever you use them.

Has this every happened to you? To have that great idea, <a href="http://www.stupidbusinessideas.com/" target="_blank">the one that looks like a real winner</a>, the one that's sure to work and make you millions? And a short while later, you find out that reality disagrees with your analysis?

Do you have any tips or techniques to avoid spending too much time on a flamethrower idea? Or how to recycle it once it goes bad, so that all the time you spent on it will not be wasted? Or how to actually distort reality into <a href="http://www.nichegeek.com/10_totally_stupid_online_business_ideas_that_made_someone_rich" target="_blank">accepting your idea</a> as the great world-changing concept you believe it should be?

Please tell me.
