Like so many of us, I spent a lot of my early career suckling (metaphorically) at <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/" target="_blank">Joel Spolsky</a>'s teat. Although he's stopped writing, the archives are still a gold mine for people who might not know about him yet. For instance, back in the 2001 stone age of computing, he came up with <a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000022.html" target="_blank">this particular bit of knowledge about multitasking</a>:
<blockquote>On the individual level -- have you ever noticed that you can assign one job to one person, and they'll do a great job, but if you assign <em>two</em> jobs to that person, they won't really get anything done? They'll either do one job well and neglect the other, or they'll do both jobs so slowly you feel like <em>slugs</em> have more zip.</blockquote>
I'm not really into the whole « choose an idol and become a fan » thing, so whenever I read something online that makes sense, I start looking for the special cases: those boundary conditions where it stops making sense. Not only is it fun to nitpick about things written nine years ago, it's also excellent food for thought.

Multi-tasking is a necessary evil. While a 1991 genius programmer could write a new OS  from scratch for a whole six months, stopping only for brief restroom pauses and keyboard-pillowed naps, he would miss the early stages of Linux and fail to contribute his efforts to a larger project.

Your brain needs a co-pilot. While your main thought process spends all day working on a given task, there should be another smaller thought process that deals with the « why am I doing this? » question. What is important here is that the co-pilot should look at the work being done with a different pair of eyes in order to ask the relevant questions, without being blinded by the assumptions that have not been context-switched out yet or the emotional involvement related to <a href="http://blog.asmartbear.com/sunk-costs.html" target="_blank">sunk costs</a>. Four eyes are better than two. That's why there's an actual co-pilot on most commercial flights.

It helps if you have an outspoken, annoying co-pilot personality. One that isn't afraid to speak out when something is boring, demeaning or a waste of your time and money. One that can bullwhip you into correcting a nasty situation instead of letting it rot slowly. The kind that you'd love to punch. In the face. With a pineapple.
