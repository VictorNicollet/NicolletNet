<small>It's time for another contest. There are no prizes this time, and the general concept is a bit different. If you wish to participate, please write a comment with your answer—they will not be posted until <strong>the contest ends on August 5, 2010</strong>. Comments containing <em>questions</em> will be published as soon as I can, along with an appropriate answer.</small>
<h3>The Problem</h3>
<blockquote>Having failed to find the correct warehouse in the previous installment, the Evil Overlord is back with a new plan : he found out that a lamp post on a street corner in Arkansas is somehow imbued with mystical powers that could be harnessed to enslave mankind. Cue maniacal laughter.

However, Empress Bing, from Alpha Centauri, knows about the lamp post too. And she wishes to use it for her own mad schemes. The two masterminds cannot fight each other over the lamp post, because it would attract attention. And neither is willing to let go.

So they decide to randomly pick which one of them gets the lamp post.

<em>You</em> have been selected by the two masterminds to help pick one of them at random. They do not trust you, so you will have to actually prove that the process used to do the picking guarantees that each of them had a 50% chance to be picked. Neither is willing to reveal their location, so you can only communicate through an encrypted text channel — you can't send them fair coins, dice or quantum states.</blockquote>
<h3>The Question</h3>
<blockquote>Propose a random selection process and prove why it's fair. Remember that the two masterminds do not trust anything you say unless it's purely deductive or they can verify it themselves.
