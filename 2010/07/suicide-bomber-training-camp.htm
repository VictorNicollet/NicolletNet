When you're doing something, there's this nice equation that can help you determine whether you'll be successful:
<p style="text-align: center;">Chances of Failure = Forces of Evil - (Brains + Experience)</p>

The Forces of Evil are constantly working towards your untimely demise. For instance, suppose you have an important meeting with your investors. Having spaghetti for lunch is a good way to get tomato sauce on your clean white shirt. You can predict this if you're smart (brains), or you can know this because it's already happened (experience).

Predicting potential issues is great. You get to avoid problems you have never encountered.

But there's a limit to how many things you can predict, especially <a href="http://xkcd.com/761/" target="_blank">in a short amount of time</a>. Geniuses who can predict everything and plan accordingly are the stuff of legends and fiction. By contrast, learning from experience is far more efficient: all you need is a good memory.

Besides, <strong>having experienced a problem first-hand lets you recognize a solution when you see it used by someone else. </strong>Have you ever noticed how hard it is to convince non-technical people of the benefits of source control when they've never had their documents overwritten by someone else?

While useful, learning from the mistakes of others is less efficient. You don't have the searing, vivid memories of your own failure to drive the lesson home, and you don't have a detailed recollection of all the little things that went wrong.

Sure, sometimes it's hard to learn from your personal experience, especially when once-in-a-lifetime situations. The cost of trying again has a huge impact on how experienced you can become.

At one end of the spectrum, we have suicide bombers. They never get a second chance. At the other end, we have modern computer programmers. They can fail as many times as necessary, because it only takes an edit-rebuild-run cycle to try again. And the ideal place to be is...

...in the middle. Because there won't be any searing, vivid memories of your failure if it can be overcome within three seconds.
