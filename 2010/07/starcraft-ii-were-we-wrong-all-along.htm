@title StarCraft II : were we wrong all along?
@draft

The original <em>StarCraft</em> game and its <em>Brood War</em> expansion pack were both released in 1998. A possible sequel, <em>StarCraft : Ghost</em>, was announced in 2002 and indefinitely postponed in 2006. <em>StarCraft II</em> itself was announced in 2007 <small>[<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELhtXtnV3pg" target="_blank">YouTube</a>]</small> and was released yesterday <small>[<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgyL08nhtkw" target="_blank">YouTube</a>]</small> <strong>twelve years</strong> after the first episode.

And it worked. Blizzard managed to keep the world buzzing about a product in development for three years. Starcraft II did not reach the top spot in the pre-order charts: <a href="http://news.punchjump.com/blog/2010/07/24/starcraft-ii-pc-pre-order-sales-top-retail-charts/" target="_blank">it reached the top <strong>two</strong> spots</a> (#1 for the game and #2 for the Collector's Edition).

Apple reliably used the same tactic ever since Steve Jobs returned; their earlier products gather a large following, the releases of major features on existing products go dormant for a while, and a strong announcement with flashy teasers is made to build up buzz for several months until a new product, the first of its kind, is finally released.

The same happens in the music industry where early previews of upcoming albums of well-known bands help build interest; this also happens in the movie industry but aside from sequels it's rare for two movies to share the same cast and director, so the «they did it right before» crowd-gathering effect is not as strong. The reliance on flashy teasers a while before the release to generate buzz remains.

It's easy to get sequel marketing wrong, though, <small>said Victor, slightly miffed that the top rank on Google for "sequel marketing" does not explain anything about marketing sequels.</small>

First, the entire success of sequel marketing relies on having a gathered fan base that listens to what you say about the original product because it's passionate about it, and ready to carry that passion over to your new product. <strong>The single worst thing you can do is alienate those followers.</strong> You have to be cautious. You have to do marketing without that crowd feeling that it's being marketed to, which is hard. Video game studio 2K went a long way to achieve this when <a href="http://www.gamespot.com/xbox360/action/bioshock2/news.html?sid=6254561">marketing the sequel to their award-winning Bioshock</a>:
<blockquote>Those fans are very sensitive to being marketed to, he stressed, so they created the "Something in the Sea" Web site, which told bits and pieces of a story about the fictional character Mark Meltzer, whose daughter was kidnapped and taken to Rapture.

They showed some of Meltzer's mail on the latter site, and the first person to send in a letter to his real-life address received back a letter from the character asking for help with deciphering some clues. That prompted an avalanche of mail, Bass said, comparing it to a scene from Miracle on 34th Street.</blockquote>
<em>Genius</em>, I say.

Another problem you can encounter when leveraging your brand is that, while a brand that is too small will have a lot of trouble gathering followers, <strong>a brand that is too large will have a lot of trouble pushing out a clear message</strong>. The size of the brand being defined as the number of products it covers: Facebook, Blizzard and even Apple are small brands, because they only have a few products: Facebook has three (the main web site, the open graph API, and the advertising business), Blizzard has four (WarCraft, StarCraft, World of Warcraft and Diablo), Apple has four (iPod, iPhone, iPad, and Macs).

Microsoft is such a huge brand (Windows, Office, Visual Studio, Silverlight, Sharepoint Server, Internet Explorer, Azure, Hotmail, Windows Live, DirectX, XNA, X-Box...) that every important announcement about a new Microsoft product is drowned in the sea of announcements for other product lines—effectively forcing Microsoft to use its <em>Microsoft</em> brand to ensure <em>recognition and trust</em>, and rely on the individual product brands to push new iterations (Visual Studio <em>2010</em>). Hence the trouble of pushing Azure, which falls somewhat outside of the existing brand lines, and a reliance on the early users of the technology (the <a href="http://blog.lokad.com/journal/2010/6/23/honored-by-the-windows-azure-partner-award-of-2010.html">2010 partner on the Microsoft Azure platform</a> is Lokad, a young french company founded by Joannès Vermorel, a fellow <em>Normalien</em>).

Adobe has the same issues as Microsoft on a smaller scale (Flash, Photoshop, Illustrator, Acrobat, Reader, Flex, LiveCycle...) and introduces new product lines by inserting them into its extensive creativity pipeline (using Flex instead of Silverlight makes a lot more sense if your company is built around the Adobe Creativity Suite, just like using Silverlight instead of Flex is better if your company is built around Visual Studio, .NET and IIS). It's not so much eager expectation (<em>I can't wait for the new Adobe product</em>) as a slippery slope (<em>I guess using Flex makes sense in our situation</em>).

The key is to launch a product that benefits from the name of previous products but does not compete with them. Apple does this by concentrating on the release of new product <strong>lines</strong>. Sure, the iPhone 4 is good and a lot of iPhone users care about it, but the emphasis was clearly placed on the nearly simultaneous release of the iPad. Blizzard does this by being in the video game business (same franchise, new story, new gameplay, and the fun of discovery) and switching between four successful product lines to leave plenty of time between iterations (12 years between SC and SCII, 6 years between WCII and WC3, 5 years between Diablo and Diablo II).

So, Adobe and Microsoft are stuck in a mire where they do not have the <em>communication</em> leverage to release new product lines like Apple does, and they're expected to release new versions of their software too often to keep the excitement alive. It's interesting to see the names of Visual C++ iterations through the ages: they were names Visual C++ N.0 from version 1.0 to version 6.0 (over the course of only five years - given the current release rates, StarCraft 6 should be expected in early 2058), then they noticed the <em>glamour</em> of N.0 was dwindling and released Visual C++ .NET, confusing an entire generation of novice C++ programmers into thinking it did not support non-.NET C++. Since then, they have resorted to a yearly naming scheme like the Office series because <strong>having FooBar 2003 in the year 2010 makes you want to upgrade in a way that no Version 10.0 will</strong>.

In short:
<ul>
	<li><strong>Apple</strong>: communicates on new product lines, quietly releases new versions of existing product lines. New product lines garner market attention and improve sales.</li>
	<li><strong>Blizzard</strong>: relies on existing product lines, rarely releases new versions. Infrequent releases and franchise branding garner market attention and improve sales.</li>
	<li><strong>Microsoft</strong>: communicates equally on new product lines and frequently released new versions of existing product lines. Market attention is too diluted for buzz or excitement to grow significantly.</li>
</ul>
Back to the point. In the web era, online software does not really have versions. You can't make people pay to use version 2.0 of your web site because everyone expects you to upgrade your web site to version 2.0 for free for everyone. This is fine if you're Microsoft or Adobe; the subscription-based model means you don't have to try as hard when releasing new versions, because <strong>there's no version 1.0 competing against your new 2.0 : your subscribers pay you either way</strong>. And the Apple strategy becomes even stronger, since there is no longer a constant buzz of new versions being released—all the marketing can concentrate on pushing forward the new product lines, like Facebook did for their Open Graph API.

However, <strong>the Blizzard strategy is completely destroyed by this approach</strong>. By delivering new updates transparently on a weekly basis, we're cut off from the possibility of releasing a grandiose new 2.0 version of our software and cashing on the sequel effect.

Your thoughts on this? If Facebook were to release an FB II that you would have to pay for, how would you feel? If you own an online business, how do you handle this?
