The fourteenth of July is the French national holiday, celebrating the <em>Fête de la Fédération</em> on July 14, 1790.

On the morning of that day, a military parade is held in Paris, consisting of at least 4000 troops on foot, in addition to the cavalry, the armored divisions, the air force and the support personnel.

And there's a rehearsal the previous day.

<strong>This parade is a one-day event that costs 20 man-years.</strong>

Remember back in 2003, when they said the Red Had 7.1 Linux distribution was the equivalent of 8000 man-years? If they took all the troops that participate in the military parade, and taught them how to code, and they spent the day writing code instead of walking around in lockstep, it would take them 400 days of collective work to replicate the functionality in that distribution.
