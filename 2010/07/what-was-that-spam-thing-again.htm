@title What was that SPAM thing, again?

I found out this small new blog called Email Marketing City. No comments or trackbacks yet. No "subscriber count" gadget, probably because there are no subscribers yet. I feel like I'm Christopher Colombus discovering new virgin lands for his queen.

Anyway, since I'm a big hater of Email Marketing (especially when I'm on the receiving side), I went straight to "<a href="http://emailmarketingcity.com/latest-information/what-exactly-is-email-marketing/" target="_blank">What exactly is Email Marketing</a>" and found the following:
<blockquote>Of course, there are some disadvantages associated with email marketing.
<ul>
	<li>SPAM – If your company constantly sends emails over and over again, some people might consider it spam and either personally boycott your company or file a civil complaint.  Obviously, this is not good for any company.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

SPAM has nothing to do with sending email <em>repeatedly</em>. Sure, if you send more mails, it only makes the situation worse. But should you smuggle even a single e-mail into my inbox without my consent, then it's SPAM, and will be treated as such—with a flamethrower (ah, <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/47324/got_spam_heres_how_to_stop_it.html" target="_blank">2001 goodness</a>).

Now, don't get the wrong idea : Email Marketing City is quite well-written and provides useful information, especially if you need to do email marketing. In fact, even if you never intend to do email marketing, you should still go over there and read some articles to see what it's like on the other side of the fence.

Still, they managed through sheer bad luck to poke me in the way nobody should ever poke me. So, back to my frothing-at-the-mouth angry rant...
<p style="text-align: center;">—</p>

I treat my e-mail as a <em>communication</em> tool. If you want to communicate <em>with</em> me, you can send me an e-mail. No, really, I mean it: just click on <a href="mailto:victor@nicollet.net">victor@nicollet.net</a> and send me that e-mail you've been burning to write about how much you hate SPAM ever since it killed your family and your dog.

But communicating <em>with </em>me is not the same as communicating <em>to</em> me. If you send me something, it's either a response to something I asked for, or something I can respond to.
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Rule 1</strong>: never send me something with a no-reply@something address, unless I explicitly asked for it.</p>

Seriously, you're sending me e-mail that I didn't ask for, but you won't allow me to send you e-mail in return? An e-mail that spells out "<em>We don't care about you, just listen to us and buy our stuff</em>" is precisely what you shouldn't be sending.
<p style="text-align: center;">—</p>

Sometimes, you will ask me for my e-mail. That's fine: I usually give it out to people when I need to hear from them. But you should make it extremely clear what you will use that e-mail for. A good example would be the Motley Fool, a financial information website <em>or something like that</em>. They offered to <strong>send me a report</strong> if I gave them my e-mail, which I did. Since June 25, 2009, I have received 174 different pieces of e-mail from the Motley Fool, and <strong>173 of these were not the report I asked for</strong>.
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Rule 2</strong>: if I give you my e-mail address because I want you to send me X, don't use it to send me Y.</p>

And, of course, should you give me the choice of receiving more mail from you...
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Rule 3:</strong> if you have a "don't send me informational mailings" checkbox and I uncheck it, respect my decision.</p>

Again, an e-mail that spells out "<em>We know you don't want to receive this, but we sent it anyway because we only care about the money</em>" is not a good message. And I don't care if you're Amazon-dot-freaking-com: if this happens even once, my business will be taken elsewhere.
<p style="text-align: center;">—</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The biggest mistake you can make with my address is to hand it out to someone else. There is no worse violation of my trust.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The second biggest mistake you can make is to send me something if you have obtained my address from someone else.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">As a simple test, I signed up for a contest on planet 49, a business that revolves around collecting personal information about the contestants and selling their contact information. At no point the sequence did I actually accept to receive promotional information (which, by law, is opt-in on all French web sites). Then I watched as 1194 pieces of promotional e-mail ended up in my inbox from companies like UPS, Honda, easyJet, HSBC and Orange Businnes [sic]. All these companies are now blacklisted: I will only purchase stuff from them as a last resort.</p>
<p style="text-align: left; padding-left: 30px;"><strong>Rule 4</strong>: should you ever get your hands on my e-mail, ask yourself whether the mail you send me will be received with feelings of anger and betrayal.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">—</p>

I've had the opportunity (for lack of a better word) to work for businesses that willingly ignored the first three rules above. I once asked why they'd break rule one—don't they want to hear back from their customers?

I still remember the senior consultant's answer on that one...
<blockquote>If we use a real address, it will be spammed by people angry about the mail we send them.</blockquote>
