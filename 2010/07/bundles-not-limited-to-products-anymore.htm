@title Bundles : Not Limited to Products Anymore
@draft

Product bundles are two or more independent products that you can buy together for a lower price than if you buy them separately, or that you are not allowed to buy separately at all. It's annoying enough that the Evil Marketing Department forces us to buy products that we don't need. But for some time now, they've been bundling our products with things we want to <strong>not have</strong>.

Try buying a book from amazon without subscribing to their <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">spam</span> promotional mailings. There's no checkbox, they just put it in their <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html/ref=hp_lnav_dyn?ie=UTF8&amp;nodeId=508088" target="_blank">conditions of use</a>:
<blockquote>When you visit Amazon.com or send e-mails to us, you are communicating with us electronically. You consent to receive communications from us electronically. We will communicate with you by e-mail or by posting notices on this site. You agree that all agreements, notices, disclosures and other communications that we provide to you electronically satisfy any legal requirement that such communications be in writing.</blockquote>
I have to consent. But that doesn't mean I'm happy about it. You can't bully your customers to grant you <a href="http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2008/01/permission-mark.html" target="_blank">permission</a> by bundling your direct marketing with the products they want.
