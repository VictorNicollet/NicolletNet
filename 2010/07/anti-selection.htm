@title Anti-Selection
@draft

Today, you're a car insurance salesman. You set up shop in a small town with only two car owners. The first one, Charles, is an excellent driver. He has owned a single well-maintained car for 20 years and still has his driver's license from 25 years ago. Never had an accident. Never had a speeding ticket. The second one, Boris, owns the same car as Charles, because he crashed the previous one into a tree two months ago. He's had ten accidents so far and lost his license twice.

One day, a man comes to buy car insurance. You have no idea whether he is Charles or Boris. What price do you offer?

Tough luck. If the man is Boris and you offer a price that's fair for Charles, he will gladly accept and collect the insurance when he has an accident next month. A loss for you. If the man is Charles and you offer a price that's fair for Boris, then he will flatly refuse. A loss for you again.

So, you get a choice between having only Boris as a customer, or having both Charles and Boris as customers but losing money to Boris' reckless driving.

This is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_selection" target="_blank"><strong>anti-selection</strong></a> : the measure that lets you reduce your losses (increase the cost of insurance) drives the profitable customers away. It's a pervasive issue for insurance companies, and is the main reason why health insurances require a complete check-up before they let you sign anything : they need to know whether you're Charles or Boris before they can decide on a price.

So what? Why should you care about the problems of the insurance industry?

You should care because this happens in other businesses as well. Almost every business has profitable customers and non-profitable customers, and should take great care to eliminate the latter to only keep the former.

<strong><a href="http://www.youtube.com/" target="_blank">YouTube</a> is a great example of avoiding anti-selection</strong>. Back when it was created, there were several services for storing images and videos online, and all of them had similar concerns about bandwidth and storage space. The standard solution was to cap the bandwidth of individual images: even today, <a href="http://imageshack.us/" target="_blank">ImageShack</a> will stop displaying an image after it has exceeded its bandwith limit.

YouTube went without any bandwidth limits. It turns out, when you have a public video-sharing website, you want people to know about you, and a video with a million views is a far better way of getting attention than a video with ten views. Had they added bandwidth limits for videos, it would have prevented the popular videos from creating awareness for YouTube, while leaving the least popular videos alone. That's anti-selection at work : reducing bandwidth costs by eliminating those videos that are the most profitable to them on the long term.

<strong>Another classic anti-selection pattern is customer support.</strong> Some customers just cost you too much because of the time they spend calling you or returning your products. It's tempting to hide behind an offshore support center designed to shield you from your customers (I know, it sounds silly).

One month ago, I signed up for a promotional offer: pay €3.15 per month to get two monthly magazines and a nice sign-up gift. They sent me the magazines for the first month, but did not send me the gift <em>or</em> charge my card. No magazines came for the second month.

On their website, the order is still "pending". I had no idea why, so I went for the "contact" menu entry, which sent me to some kind of FAQ (<em>first mistake</em>). There, I picked "What is the status of my order?" which opened a contact form that was not pre-filled with the contact information of my account (<em>second mistake</em>). I reluctantly filled in the form, noticed there was no "question" field, and waited. The next day, I received an e-mail telling me where I could find my order status back on their web site (<em>third mistake</em>).

So, I'm basically a good customer willing to hand them money every month and their brain-dead customer service <strong>forbids me</strong> to do so. Nice job, <a href="http://www.prisma-presse.com/" target="_blank">Prisma Presse</a>.

Look at Zappos: they allow anyone to <a href="http://www.zappos.com/shipping-and-returns" target="_blank">return their shoes for free</a>, for a full refund, no questions asked, up to one year after buying them. They're <em>begging</em> Boris to abuse the hell out of their return policy! But making Charles happy ultimately brings higher profits than making sure Boris stays away from them. Not to mention the attention they get for being so extreme.

Ask yourself this simple question: who are your <em>Charles</em> customers? Not necessarily those who bring in the most dough, but those who actually help you grow your business through feedback or sponsoring of other customers or saying nice things about you on social media... and who are your <em>Boris</em> customers? Are there so many of them that you need to take action?
