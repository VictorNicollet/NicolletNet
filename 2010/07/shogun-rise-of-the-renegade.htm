It looks absolutely great&mdash;can't wait to get my hands on it (I might even buy a smartphone so I can play it). It should be available next month on iPhone and Samsung Wave, shortly followed by an Android release. 

Shogun was meant to be the follow-up project to Darklaga (the video game I developed with int13 back in 2004), but I had to leave the team without being able to start working on it seriously. It's good to see that they managed to get the project out of the closet to develop and release it five years after its inception.

Plus, that's a little bit of my own legacy right there&mdash; the "Shogun" part of the name was my idea!
