<strong>Beware of success.</strong> The London underground recently started publishing information about the position and movement of trains, and their estimated time of arrival at their next station. There was a <a href="http://traintimes.org.uk:81/map/tube/" target="_blank">demo</a> of that online. <em>Was</em>. The load on the servers was so high that <a href="http://data.london.gov.uk/blog/tube-feed-update">they had to shut down</a> the API. That's what you get when you don't plan for success.

<strong>Some people hate pie.</strong> You know this number: 3.141592... ? has been arbitrarily defined as the circumference-to-diameter radius by some mathematicians in ancient Greece ages ago, and had remained this way ever since. However, in modern physics, the circumference-to-<em>diameter</em> ratio has no real meaning, but the circumference-to-<em>radius</em> ratio does. Hence the <a href="http://tauday.com/" target="_blank">proposal to stop using ? everywhere</a> and start using ? (defined as 2?) instead.

<strong>Stock market news</strong>. Apparently, <a href="http://seekingalpha.com/article/101561-rare-batman-pattern-forming-in-the-vix" target="_blank">Batman has come</a> to save us from the crisis.

<strong>Logo love</strong>. I'm a complete fan of this logo (it depicts both a man playing golf and a head with a helmet).

In almost unrelated news, you can get a logo for $200 at <a href="http://www.logomyway.com/" target="_blank">LogoMyWay</a>.

<strong>Being non-professional-looking is great.</strong> It basically went like this: I clicked on some ad banner or something, and ended up on <a href="http://www.steampunkcouture.com/" target="_blank">SteampunkCouture</a>. Being interested in pretty ladies clad in steampunk garments, and in dressing up my own pretty lady in said garments (<em>I know you're reading this, dear</em>), I peek around.

Only to discover that their web developer wrote <em>aray</em> instead of <em>array</em>.

Normally, I would have gone away, but SPC advertises themselves as a small friendly shop instead of a large ecommerce gig. Which means I'm not afraid to use their contact form (to me, contact forms are the internet equivalent of selling my soul), because I assume they won't mass-spam me once they get their hands on my email.

So, I tell them their website is down, and they should contact me when it's up again. Because I know I can trust them with my e-mail address. Isn't it strange that one would trust a small website with one's email, but not a larger professional one?

Anyway, SPC is back online. And, as a true professional, Kato (the fashion designer) knows how to write a business e-mail to tell me the bug has been corrected.
<blockquote>Should be up now my luv</blockquote>
<em>This</em> is what I love about small businesses.
