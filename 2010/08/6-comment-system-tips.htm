If you're trying to set up a comment system for your web site, there are a few tips I want to share with you:
<ol>
	<li>At first, moderate everything. The spam bots will find you faster than the real users will, and despite genuine advances in anti-spam technology, some spam <em>will</em> slip through. Once you get a decent number of readers who comment on your post, disable comment moderation.</li>
	<li>Let people provide their web site address. Not only does this motivate people with blogs to comment on a high-traffic web site (because it brings them traffic), but this makes your web site a good place for other readers to find interesting links.</li>
	<li>If you ask people for their e-mail address, do not spam them—a <em>thank you</em> e-mail is usually fine, but unexpected mail from a web site breeds anger and hatred.</li>
	<li><strong>Never ask for e-mail validation before you let people post comments</strong>. 99% will give up, and by the time the validation e-mail arrives in their inbox, 99% of those remaining will have lost their interest in writing a comment.</li>
	<li>If you don't have too many comments, respond to as many as you can. What you need is a conversation and a feeling of mutual respect and empathy, otherwise, people won't come back. If they provide a blog link, go read that blog and comment there as well.</li>
	<li>Don't use captcha validation. If you do, make sure people only have to enter it once (as opposed to once every time they write a new comment).</li>
</ol>
