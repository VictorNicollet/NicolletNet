People are used to financial data being represented as plots of value against time. Other visualizations might provide a different understanding of what is going on. This is a soap bubble animation of the main composite indices of six major countries, based on weekly values between 2000 and 2010 that I stole from Yahoo! Finance:
<ul>
	<li><img src="/files/blog/bubbles/us.png" alt="" /> Dow Jones</li>
	<li><img src="/files/blog/bubbles/fr.png" alt="" /> CAC 40</li>
	<li><img src="/files/blog/bubbles/uk.png" alt="" /> Footsie 100</li>
	<li><img src="/files/blog/bubbles/de.png" alt="" /> DAX</li>
	<li><img src="/files/blog/bubbles/jp.png" alt="" /> NIKKEI 225</li>
	<li><img src="/files/blog/bubbles/cn.png" alt="" /> SSE</li>
</ul>
The radius of the bubble represents the value of the index: the scales have been arbitrarily chosen so that all the bubbles have the same size in January 2000.

</div>
Viewing the data as an animation instead of a plot really helps underline the meanings of «sudden» and «simultaneous» that would otherwise be lost with a static representation, especially around August 2002 and August 2008. The huge, screen-blotting Chinese bubble is quite impressive, too. In the end, most bubbles are as large as they were in the beginning, if not smaller. 

For historical reference, these are the plots for the six indices:

What are your opinions on this animation? Does it work on your browser? Are there any similar data visualizations you would like to see here? Is there a point in explaining the bloody technical details behind rendering this baby? 

Noticed the <code>[type Function]</code> bug in the bottom left corner of the Yahoo Finance image? ;)
