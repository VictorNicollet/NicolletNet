<strong>Frameworks</strong>. Every single tech person is touting around the word Framework these days. And we all seem to have a different definition about it. Even when it obviously does not apply. Here's what a <a href="http://www.cherrysave.com/tools/rapid-web-design-with-blueprint-css-framework/" target="_blank">tutorial </a>had to say about the Blueprint CSS Framework :
<blockquote>Blueprint CSS isn’t really a framework in the sense that it’s not MVC (model-view-controller) like something like Ruby on Rails</blockquote>
Way to go kid. Don't go around confusing Frameworks with <em>MVC Web Server</em> Frameworks (of which Ruby on Rails is an example). Also, do check out <a href="www.blueprintcss.org" target="_blank">Blueprint CSS</a>, it's quite good for small-ish projects without a great web designer on hand.

<strong>Drive-through open source</strong>. On the topic of having fewer tech people around you yet still managing to set up your free open source tools, <a href="http://bitnami.org/stacks" target="_blank">Bitnami</a> offers free installers for the main open source applications. Instead of having to hunt down appropriate versions and configuratios of Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP to run your Drupal web site, just download and install the Drupal <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">package</span> stack.

<strong>Gifts and choices</strong>. In <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/main/news/archive/S27/52/51O99/index.xml" target="_blank">a powerful address at Princeton</a>, Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos explains the difference between a gift (I'm good at doing X) and a choice (I decided to do Y) and the power of X=Y. Go read it. It's great. <em>If you're wondering whether you should quit your job and start a company, go read it again. It only gets better.</em>

<strong>DNS Propagation</strong>. Need to point your domain to another server, and wondering how many DNS servers have already caught up on the modification? <a href="http://www.whatsmydns.net/" target="_blank">WhatsMyDNS.net</a> handles this for you. It's free and very useful (albeit in an extremely specific situation).
