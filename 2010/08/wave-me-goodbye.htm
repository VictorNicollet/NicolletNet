Google announced last Wednesday that they would <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/08/update-on-google-wave.html" target="_blank">discontinue Google Wave</a>: 
<blockquote>But despite these wins, and numerous loyal fans, Wave has not seen the user adoption we would have liked. We don’t plan to continue developing Wave as a standalone product, but we will maintain the site at least through the end of the year and extend the technology for use in other Google projects.</blockquote>

Google Wave is a web application that enables rich communication between Google Wave users. Rich meant a lot of things, such as sending as sending specific widgets directly (instead of sending a link to Google Maps or Doodle by e-mail, you could embed them), or moving away from the &laquo;every message is standalone&raquo; approach of e-mail and keeping track of <em>conversations</em> (sequences of messages) instead. 

I remember Wave for the astronomical amounts of hype that surrounded it in the early days. It was said to be revolutionary. You had to be invited to use it, and there were only so many invitations around. And regardless of the apparent lack of interest, Google Wave <em>is</em> an impressive and exciting technical achievement:
<blockquote>Last year at Google I/O, when we launched our developer preview of Google Wave, a web app for real time communication and collaboration, it set a high bar for what was possible in a web browser. We showed character-by-character live typing, and the ability to drag-and-drop files from the desktop, even “playback” the history of changes—all within a browser. Developers in the audience stood and cheered. Some even waved their laptops.</blockquote>

Yet, Google Wave was designed as an application for <em>communication and collaboration</em>. Such applications, by design, need several people to be using it together. It's a classic chicken-and-egg situation: I won't use the system if I have no one to talk to, and I won't have anyone to talk to if other people don't use the system. And Google Wave made two mistakes here which prevented it from reaching the expected critical mass.

This morning, I turned my computer on. Within seconds, Skype and <strike>MSN</strike> <em>Windows</em> Live Messenger launched as well. These bloody parasites increase my boot time. But they're doing the Right Thing: this means every time my computer is on, they will be running. Let me rephrase that: every time my <em>friends'</em> computers are on, they will be running. This increases the probability that my friends will appear online for me to talk to them, which in turn increases the usefulness of the software. 

It means that if Alice asks Bob to install Skype so she can send him a large file (or view his screen for some tech support, or whatever), then <strong>Bob will be connected to Skype all the time, even though he does not believe it to be useful.</strong> 

On the internet, there's no special "Launch when Windows starts" flag you can use to keep your users connected to your web site all the time. You have to rely on your users to either come back to the web site of their own accord every day, or set up your web site as their home page. <strong>Bob will only be connected on Google Wave if he genuinely believes it to be useful.</strong> This is an extremely important difference, and it was Google's first mistake. 

<p style="padding: 30px 0 30px 20px">
<strong>Rule 1.</strong> To achieve a critical mass for an application that revolves around user collaboration, you need to attach it to another application that is used on an extremely regular basis by the users.</p>

Skype attaches itself to Windows. Facebook chat attaches itself to Facebook. Gmail chat attaches itself to Gmail. Google Wave attaches itself to... nothing.

Then, there was the <em>other</em> issue. Google decided that Wave would be initially available only by direct invitation, and every Wave user would only get a limited number of invitations. I think there were only eight. How could this have gone wrong? The reduced availability combined with the persistent Buzz made everyone run around in circles looking for invitations! Contests were held to <a href="http://www.dator.fr/concours-gagnez-15-invitations-google-wave-sur-dator-fr/" target="_blank">win Wave invitations</a> <small>[fr]</small>! Instead of thinking &laquo;oh, I'll try it someday&raquo; everyone thought &laquo;I have to get my hands on an invitation <em>now</em>&raquo; !

I managed to get my hands on a Google Wave account when someone on my alumni network newsgroup offered them to anyone interested. I signed up, and was faced with a mostly empty screen. My contact list was empty, save for the person who had invited me (whom I knew in a &laquo;keep in touch&raquo; way, but not enough to warrant using Google Wave). I toyed around a bit with the interface, failed to get the point of it all, and never came back.

For someone in the web analytics business, Google made a pretty surprising error: they went for a high <em>quantity</em> of eyeballs, instead of a high <em>quality</em>. <strong>They attracted people through curiosity and the illusion of a shortage, instead of attracting people that wanted to communicate with existing users.</strong>

<p style="padding: 30px 0 30px 20px">
<strong>Rule 2.</strong> If your software relies on people using it together, then you should target non-users that might want to use your software with existing users.
</p>

The invitation model worked for Gmail because you can use it to send mail to any person on earth with an e-mail address. It worked for the early Facebook because of the privacy implications (you don't want to invite someone unless you are comfortable with sharing your personal information with them) and because the friends of your friends are usually your friends as well (so you fill your contact list very fast). <strong>But with Google Wave, you could get yourself invited by anyone, and you would end up with an empty contact list and an useless application.</strong>

To quote Seth Godin, <strong>Ideas that spread, win.</strong> And here is a Godin-ly good hour-long video of his talk at Business of Software 2008:
