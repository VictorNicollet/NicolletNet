@title The Four Stages of Communities
@draft

Alison Bechdel is the author of the <a href="http://dykestowatchoutfor.com/" target="_blank">Dykes to Watch out For</a> webcomic. One of the characters has three simple and apparently obvious rules to decide whether she wants to see a movie. These are known as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dykes_to_Watch_Out_For#Bechdel_test" target="_blank">Bechdel Test</a>, and look for movies that:
<ol>
	<li> have two female characters</li>
	<li>who talk to each other</li>
	<li>about something other than a man</li>
</ol>
They may sound obvious, but <a href="http://bechdeltest.com/" target="_blank">popular movies fail the test on a regular basis</a>.

The same applies to communities led by a figurehead, such as blogs or fan pages.
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Stage Zero happens when there are no participants. It's a sad place.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Stage One happens when there are some participants who leave comments and interact with the figurehead, but mostly ignore each other.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Stage Two happens when the participants start interacting.</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;">Stage Three happens when the participants, still interacting with each other, start going off-topic and discuss things beyond the original purpose of the community.</p>

Most communities get to Stage One. Yet, even as they get hundreds of participants, getting them to interact together is harder. Hundreds of people go write "<em>Great Post! I completely agree with you!</em>" in the comments section of every article on 10k-subscriber blogs because this gets them some free back links. It takes a lot of spine and insight to actually write something original, contradict the author on his own blog or <em>*shudder*</em> go post on a brand new blog with only a few subscribers.

This blog is still in Stage One. I think Stage Two is a nice place to be, and my regular posters seem to be clever and decisive enough to go beyond the "<em>Great Post! I completely agree with you!</em>" wall. Stage Three would be even better ;)
