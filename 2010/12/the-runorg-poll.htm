@title The RunOrg Poll
@draft

This week-end, we published on the RunOrg website <a href="http://www.runorg.com/about/sondage" target="_&quot;blank&quot;">a poll about the use and misuse of information technologies in associations</a>. <strong>Why?</strong> Because we're Start-Up founders, and working week-ends is part of the package. <strong>Ha ha, I mean, why this poll?</strong> Oh, right. I'll get to that in a minute, but first, if you're one of my french readers and happen to be a member of an association, please <a href="http://www.runorg.com/about/sondage" target="_blank">visit the poll page and respond</a>. It won't take long, and it might also answer that question.

So, why this poll? Well, there's a distinct lack of statistical information on the topic — and although our market analysis answers the critical question of whether there's money to be earned, it's not nearly as precise or global as our curiosity would expect. There are many problems that information technology can solve in association, and until we take over the world in Q4 2011 we don't expect RunOrg to solve more than a handful of these by itself, but we would still be happy to know what these other problems really are and how they are solved so far.

Gathering information about unexplored topics is also a great way to build a reputation of expertise and excellence. The results of the poll will be made available freely on the internet, in the same fashion as <a href="http://blog.okcupid.com/index.php/how-races-and-religions-match-in-online-dating/" target="_blank">OkCupid's How Races and Religions Match in Online Dating</a> and the <a href="http://www.mint.com/blog/trends/coffee-day-09202010/?display=wide" target="_blank">Mint infographics</a>, which should <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">improve our google ranking</span> <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">bring us more customers</span> help people find the Association IT experts they have been looking for.

The results should be interesting, but the questions themselves are hopefully quite helpful: most of them are pretty obvious to natives of the information age, yet a complete surprise to everyone else. A significant number of associations from our initial sample still rely on a pen-and-paper system for handling <em>everything</em>, with a nice web site designed for them by a tech-savvy member that left two years ago (and that hasn't been updated ever since). If something as simple as getting the web site right is so hard, what about handling a newsletter or mailing list? Letting members pay their subscription fee online? That our poll asks associations <em>whether they do it</em> hints at the <em>possibility of doing it</em>.

<em>Oh, you can have people pay their subscription online</em>? Asked one early participant (well, poll beta-tester, actually), who has since set up a PayPal subscription process.

If we're in the business of building wondrous solutions to pervasive problems, I'd rather have everyone know that <em>these problems can be solved</em>. I strongly suspect one of the biggest issues with our product is that <strong>our potential clients believe no solution exists</strong> — anything we can do to alleviate this issue is welcome, even if it means those potential customers will also become more aware of our competitors' products in the process.

Really, I'd rather have everyone using our competitors' products than using pen and paper in the XXI<sup>st</sup> century.
