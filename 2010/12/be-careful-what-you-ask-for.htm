@title Be Careful What You Ask For

Jumo is a brand new social network that lets you connect with the causes and organizations that you support. They started their open beta recently, so I chimed in to see what was going on over there.

I didn't get past the signup form. Not because of any bugs or technical difficulties, but because of this:

So, it turns out that to connect to Jumo, you need to have a valid Facebook account. Why not? Letting your users connect through Facebook is a good strategy to gather information easily (it lets the user import his personal information from Facebook instead of typing it by hand). Requiring a Facebook account is probably a bit <em>too extreme </em>in my opinion, especially when it's technically unnecessary, but I can live with it, especially since my Facebook profile is designed to contain only public information.

The showstopper here is that I need to grant <strong>permission to post on my wall</strong>. I'm utterly and irrevocably paranoid about my online image, so anything that looks like me saying things I don't actually want to say is grounds for immediate rejection. I have absolutely no idea what Jumo is going to do with this permission once granted, and the last few times I've seen that permission granted by my friends, shady applications flooded their walls with advertising for other third party sites said friends knew nothing about. I'm pretty sure Jumo is not going to do <em>that</em>, but them asking for permission can only mean one thing: sooner or later, a message from Jumo will appear on my wall without letting me review its contents first.

Ultimately, this is a gamble: by asking for wall access, Jumo is willingly throwing away all the reputation-obsessed people who will not grant that permission, but earns the right to post a message on the walls of all those people who don't care enough about Jumo to write that message of their own accord. And they're playing their cards just right, because people like me are a minority. But that doesn't mean it's not a cheap, dirty trick.
