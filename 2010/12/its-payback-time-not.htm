Why do generosity and sharing survive? Giving stuff away without asking for something in return is irrational. In a cold, rational society, those who give willingly would be taken advantage of by free riders until they wither and go away. Well, it sounds like humans are conditioned to find and punish free riders, and unfair behavior in general.

A recent experiment by <a href="http://reason.com/archives/2010/11/30/the-eleventh-commandment-punis" target="_blank">Ryan McKay</a> illustrated this quite clearly. Subjects were grouped in pairs, one of the two was given a lump of money and told he could share any or all of it with the other. The second subject could then spend the money he received to reduce the first subject's earnings at a 3:1 ratio (so spending $1 would reduce the first subject's earnings by $3), thereby punishing him for being unfair. Priming the second subject with words related to religion caused the second subject to have a significantly more aggressive punishment behavior — they would rather lose $1 than have an unfair individual earn $3.

Combine this with <a href="http://www.ted.com/talks/dan_ariely_on_our_buggy_moral_code.html" target="_blank">Dan Ariely</a>'s conclusions in a cheating-based experiment: subjects were given a timed examination, and were rewarded based on how many questions they <em>said </em>they had answered — so you could cheat and say you answered all the questions, and get the maximum payout, even if you did pretty badly on the test. The first conclusion was that everyone cheated by a little amount, which is fairly interesting in itself, but the second conclusion was very surprising: by asking the participants to remember the Ten Commandments before taking the test, all cheating was eliminated, including those people who self-identified as atheists and therefore had no <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6YyWi4eQCI" target="_blank">earning-points-for-the-afterlife</a> motivation to respect the Ten Commandments. Ariely's entire talk is pretty interesting for that matter:

In short, we're nice to each other because 1° that's the way we were conditioned to be and 2° the others will punish us if we don't. The problem with the Internet is that it's a mostly anonymous environment, so reason 2° goes out the window. You can't punish someone you don't know and probably lives in a different country. It follows that people who are not affected by reason 1° and find out reason 2° does not apply will take advantage of everyone else.

The New York Times ran a moving piece about <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/28/business/28borker.html?_r=3&amp;pagewanted=all" target="_blank">Vitaly Borker</a>, who has set up a fairly interesting business model: he waits for people to land on the web page of his DecorMyEyes online shopping site, and buy a pair of designer glasses. Once this happens, he buys fake glasses from eBay, ships an incomplete package and charges more than what was billed. From the New York Times piece:
<blockquote>[She] placed an order for both the Lafonts and a set of doctor-prescribed Ciba Vision contact lenses on that site, DecorMyEyes.com. The total cost was $361.97. [...] The next day, a man named Tony Russo called to say that DecorMyEyes had run out of the Ciba Visions. Pick another brand, he advised a little brusquely. [...] With the contacts issue unresolved, her eyeglasses arrived two days later. But the frames appeared to be counterfeits [...] Soon after, she discovered that DecorMyEyes had charged her $487 — or an extra $125.</blockquote>
And once the customers ask for a refund or threaten to get their money back from their bank, DecorMyEyes threatens them with lawsuits, and stalks them on Google Earth and sends them a picture of their home to bully them into giving up their money.

The elegant part of this business model is that this outrageous customer «service» means those people who ended up on the wrong side of a DecorMyEyes transaction will complain about it on the internet. The typical Google search for DecorMyEyes yields pages upon pages of angry «<em>don't buy from DecorMyEyes</em>» customer reviews. This should even the odds and let everyone know it's a hellish scamlike business, right? Wrong. Most people will never do a search for DecorMyEyes, even if they're about to give them their credit card number. Silly humans. On the other hand, since all those angry reviews invariably linked to the company's website, their Google rating blew through the roof, which in turn let them end up in delicious spots in searches that really matter, like «Ciba Vision» and incidentally prove me right as far as<a href="http://www.nicollet.net/2010/11/get-rid-of-your-brand/" target="_blank"> my earlier theories about scamming</a> go:
<ul>
	<li>Relying on repeat business is impractical — glasses are a rare, costly expense.</li>
	<li>There are no dominant brands that own the market — at least, not on the Internet selling French glasses in the US.</li>
	<li>There is little to no contact between potential customers — because humans don't do reputation research.</li>
</ul>
Customer losses are estimated at $1.7 <strong>billion</strong>. Nice one. Vitaly Borker has been going at it for at least two years, and there's still no public righteous avenger wrath going on. The Internet is too busy righteous-avenger-wrathing <a href="http://boingboing.net/2010/08/24/internet-finds-cat-t.html" target="_blank">a lady who puts a cat in a trash bin</a> to go after a billion-dollar bully.

Silly Internet.
