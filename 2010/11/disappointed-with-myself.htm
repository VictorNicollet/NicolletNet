@title I'm Terribly Disappointed with Myself

I know it sounds sad, but actually, I wish I could be even <em>more</em> disappointed with my self.

Many successful people around me (and by <em>successful</em>, I mean <em>the target of my secret envious hatred</em>) have a strange and yet obvious personality trait: they believe the things a person does are an accurate reflection of that person's quality as a human being. For instance, they might be convinced that a person who wakes up at 9:00 am <em>on a Tuesday</em> is a lazy sloth that is subtly inferior to non-lazy non-sloth types. What reflections a given action casts is ultimately a consequence of their upbringing, education and personal beliefs — in two men kissing each other in public, one may see perversion and shameful sin where the other sees courage and happiness. You will never hear these people utter «well, he can live his life however he wants» about anyone — in anything, they see either grandeur or mediocrity, but never open-minded neutrality, and anything that may sound like neutrality is either polite self-censorship or bored indifference.

These people are sincere. Not only do they say that waking up at 9:00 on a workday is irresponsible, but they wouldn't be caught <em>dead</em> waking up at 9:00 on a workday. The noble, respectable thing to do is to wake up at 7:00 and they will do so because their pride and their opinion of themselves depends on it.

And that is why they're successful. Let me explain.

Everyone wants to be successful, because everyone hates mediocrity. And yet, if I asked you «What's your plan for being successful?» it would involve a lot of hesitation and a lot of things that are oddly reminiscent of things you are <em>already</em> doing (ironically, that's also what the successful people would answer, but at least <em>they're</em> right). The biggest issue with being successful is the lack of a road map.

The end result is a descent into mediocrity: when you were a small child, you wanted to be an astronaut. When you were in middle school, you had lesser yet prestigious dreams of having a great job and living in a great neighborhood with a great family. As you get older, your job and home expectations get increasingly lower as you find outsome of your objectives are too difficult to achieve, until you decide you're lucky to have whatever you ended up with.

Those people who have a sharp opinion about every single thing around them? They have a much easier time avoiding that slippery slope, because «I guess this is acceptable» grey areas are simply not a part of their world view. If they took a second-rate job anywhere, it would sting like sharp, rusty jalapeño-coated needles. They have a ten mile wide road map with «you are not here» written all over it in blood and tears of shameful disappointment. No wonder they ended up where they did. And they cannot find any excuses, because they're not just trying to impress their friend or keep up with the Joneses: the only judge of their eventual success is their own opinion of what is great and what is not.

Are you happy with yourself? With your job? With your home? <em>They never are</em>.

It sounds like a sad life. But I ask: is a parent not constantly disappointed with specific things their child does, and still proud of him at the same time? The way to stay sane is to constantly remember that things should be better, and yet to be proud of the life you lead.
