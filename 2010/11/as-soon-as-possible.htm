As you might expect from a Start-Up team, we of <a href="http://www.nicollet.net/2010/10/runorg-aka-muahahaha/" target="_blank">RunOrg</a> work alone on whatever task we have to do, with fragmentary communication during the day and frequent one-hour meetings to discuss the state of the project. We have a pretty clean road map ahead of us, but there's a lot of unexpected or unpredictable things going on in the early months of a start-up: new, cheaper service providers on the market let us do a 180° turn on our production strategy ; an administrative process requires immediate submission of even more forms (oh God, let it <em>end</em>!) ; important customers show up and want to discuss our product-to-be ; something important happens in the life of one of the three associates, crippling 33% of the work force for a short while ...

After a few weeks, there's one lesson to be learned : <strong>in a start-up, there is no such thing as ASAP</strong>.

Suppose I'm your core product developer (not a very bold assumption) and you need me to fill in some administrative form, because you're in charge of asking for a government grant. There's a pretty tight deadline, so you tell me to send back that form <em>ASAP</em>. The problem being that almost every single other thing I need to do needs to be done ASAP: set up the production server backups, correct that bug that sends ten thousand password recovery e-mails for every single request, submit some critical information for a conference we're attending, and give some developer from FoobarCorp technical details about our API. So, there's a chance that by the end of the week, I'll be done with your form, <em>unless the server dies at 11 p.m. the day before and I spend the night bringing it back to life</em>.

You know that the administrative form is a 10-minute task that needs to be done by Tuesday evening and that could win or lose us $25,000 but I don't have any information about it other than its urgency. Why is it so important? I know why the server backups are important because I've put them on my todo-list myself and I have an intimate knowledge of what is at stake. I know what it means to receive ten thousand e-mails for a single password request. I just cannot feel the same about an administrative form that you dump on me. In fact, the only reason you said it was to be done ASAP might be that for the last few weeks I've been passively filtering out any non-ASAP requests from you. The oral equivalent of writing V!agra instead of Viagra to get your spam e-mail past the spam filters.

It's nothing personal. It's just a consequence of three environmental factors:
<ul>
	<li>Everyone is overworked, so tasks that are not blatantly important might be postponed forever.</li>
	<li>We're equals, so you can't give me «drop everything and do this now» orders.</li>
	<li>You didn't give me enough information to decide how important your request is.</li>
</ul>
This is a nasty mix. To get over it, there are two simple rules you can follow.

The first rule is the requester's responsibility: <strong>always add a deadline to your requests</strong>. If you tell me that you need those forms for Tuesday evening, there will be no ambiguity as to the urgency of the matter — I could have questions about the priority (<em>is this form more important than setting up the server backups?</em>) and it's up to you to defend the importance (<em>this could win us $25,000</em>) until we agree on whether the action is must-have (<em>$25,000? of course we'll do it</em>), nice-to-have (<em>$250? I'll see if I have time</em>...) or ridiculous (<em>$2.5? are you kidding me?</em>). Basically, we're working together to help me fit this new task in my own mental priority queue.

The second rule is symmetrical: <strong>always ask for a deadline</strong>. «<em>We need to frobnicate the product as soon as possible</em>» could equally mean «<em>drop everything and frobnicate the product immediately or we'll be sued to hell and back</em>» or «<em>make a mental note to add frobnication on the Q3 2011 wishlist</em>» and whatever level of urgency you thought you heard is probably not the level the requester intended. You can ask for a deadline explicitly, or you can provide a plausible deadline based on your current load — do whichever you believe fits the situation, both are ultimately equivalent.
