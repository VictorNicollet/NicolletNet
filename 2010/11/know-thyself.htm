What do you enjoy about this project? What do you utterly hate about it? What's the long-term motivation that keeps you working on it : fame, money, passion, something else?

What are the day-to-day activities that you love doing? What would you rather not do? Do these match your actual skills, or are you unskilled in what you love and hate what you're skilled in?

When and where are you the most productive? Are you a regular worker, or do you have infrequent bursts of productivity?

I'm glad you took the time to know all of these tidbits about yourself. It really helps.
