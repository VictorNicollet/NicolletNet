@title Low-Cost Software

Low-Cost is all about having a dirt cheap base product, such as plane trips, combined with additional fees for almost every single thing you can imagine, such as carry-on luggage, using the restrooms during the flight, or wearing a blonde wig. In the B2C and B2IB (<a href="http://ittybiz.com/" target="_blank">Business-to-Itty-Biz</a>) worlds, the Low-Cost model works when it seems fair. Asking people to pay for what they use is fair in two ways:
<ul>
	<li><strong>Share the cost</strong>: What I use costs the company money. They went to great lengths to drive the base price down, so it's only fair that I participate in any additional expenses I cause.</li>
	<li><strong>Avoid free riders</strong>: If I don't have heavy luggage or use the restrooms, I won't have to pay for the kerosene spent carrying around other people's luggage or the water for their restroom usage.</li>
</ul>
That's why a Low-Cost model cannot charge for wearing a blonde wig : the wig doesn't cost the airplane company anything, so there's no reason they should charge you for it.

This obsession with fairness goes head-to-head against traditional economic theory. In a traditional economic world with purely rational agents, everyone agrees that a printer that prints 100 pages/minute costs more than a printer that prints 20 pages/minute. In our real world, if the 20-pages printer is the exact same hardware as the 100-pages printer with a speed inhibitor tacked on, bloody murder <em>will</em> be screamed. Of course, big businesses don't care — it's a game everyone plays, so they're going to negotiate discounts and settle for the higher price anyway — but if you're targeting the B2C/B2IB market and they find out you're into that kind of backstabbing, you're done for.

If you're going for a product with multiple prices, or with additional features available for a fee, remember that customers will be looking at the price difference through two very different lenses:
<ul>
	<li><strong>Is it worth it</strong>? Does that $5 feature provide me with happiness or productivity that exceeds $5?</li>
	<li><strong>Is it fair</strong>? Does that $5 feature cost the provider anything close to $5, or are they just gouging me for the fun (and gross margin) of it?</li>
</ul>
In the software world, we're all concentrating on the first question, but we had better keep away from the second one : writing software is <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">dirt</span> open-source cheap.

It's fair to ask for some money when you've spent weeks working on a feature. It stops being fair when you cripple your software to create a cheaper version. And by «cripple» I do not necessarily mean removing or blocking existing features: willingly straying from the optimal design to be able to monetize a feature that would have been an immediate consequence of that optimal design.

Are you providing some of your users with daily backups, instead of guaranteeing that you will never lose their data?

Are you trying to sell data recovery features by selling a product without a revision history tool?

Are you actively fighting third party data conversion tools to force customers into buying your own data extraction plug-in?

Are you limiting the number of anything (users, posts, files...) that the users are doing with your software on <em>their</em> computers?
