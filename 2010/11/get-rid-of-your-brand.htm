@title Get Rid of your Brand
@draft

Brands are universally recognized as being a good thing to have—a form of crystallized identity that lets your customers recognize that they've heard about you, or bought from you, before.

On the other hand, brands require certain sacrifices. First, for a brand to be meaningful, you need to support it by being <strong>reliably exceptional</strong>. The «exceptional» part isn't the hardest, because unless you're entering a market that's already fairly saturated (say, creating a new take-away chinese food outlet) your very existence is exceptional. Or maybe it is the hardest, but I don't want to discuss it right now so you'll have to wait until later. On the other hand, the «reliable» part requires some pretty sexy logistics: if Coca Cola tasted differently every time you bought a new can, the brand wouldn't stay around for long, which means most of the engineering firepower was applied to creating an easily reproduced (and transported/stored) beverage, instead of having a great but easily messed up taste.

Second, you simply <a href="http://thebrandbuilder.wordpress.com/2010/11/10/care-or-die-because-customer-loyalty-isnt-really-rocket-science/" target="_blank">cannot be an ass to your customers</a>. In fact, if screwing your customers over is part of your business plan, you actually want to avoid having any kind of brand that would let customers recognize you. Acquiring a non-brand is fairly easy if you stick to online-only presence, generic logos and a <strong>content-free domain name</strong>. If a bittorrent download website proves utterly unhelpful and annoying, are you going to remember its name? Was it torrent<em>room</em>, torrent<em>reactor</em>, torrent<em>z</em>, torrent<em>scan</em>, torrent<em>ornottorrent</em> ... ?

In fact, the business model of torrent download websites can be summarized as follows:

<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2156" title="found-torrents" src="http://www.nicollet.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/found-torrents.png" alt="" width="670" height="300" />

I've been searching for <a href="http://www.cracked.com/article_18567_6-japanese-subcultures-that-are-insane-even-japan.html">my sanity</a> and ended up on this page. The only piece of information here is found at the bottom: «total <strong>0</strong> torrents found» and basically everything else on the page is just a clever setup engineered to trick the visitor into believing my sanity can be found at these five locations. The blue «sponsored search results» heading is a blatant lie—those five lines are not search results, they're going to appear exactly as shown regardless of what you're searching for (except the initial bold text, replaced with your search keywords), and it's all designed to be as desirable as possible: <strong>TRUSTED</strong> DOWNLOAD (trusted by whom?), <strong>Fast</strong> Download, <strong>Full Version</strong>, <strong>Rapid</strong>share, sizes of 1.31 GB or ~700MB that are fairly typical of movies, and near-100% health.

Clicking through leads to a web site that will try to extract as much money as possible from you before you finally notice that my sanity is nowhere to be found.

I can accept that some people online are stupid enough to pay an anonymous shady website in the hopes of watching that movie without paying the movie publisher. I refuse to believe that <a href="http://xkcd.com/242/" target="_blank">anyone would be fooled more than once</a> by this tactic. But just to be on the safe side, you don't want people to remember you after you've done this to them.

This no-branding, screw-the-customer approach works pretty well for areas where:
<ul>
	<li>Relying on repeat business is impractical</li>
	<li>There are no dominant brands that own the market.</li>
	<li>There is little to no contact between potential customers.</li>
</ul>
Torrent search websites are one example: repeat business is impractical for the same legal reasons as the absence of dominant brands (as soon as you <a href="http://thepiratebay.org/legal.php" target="_blank">become noticeable</a>, the RIAA/MPAA shut you down), and people tend to remain anonymous while searching for torrents so there is no contact between such people.

Another example would be <strong>plumbers</strong>. Repeat business is hard to get (the better you are, the longer your customers can go on without calling for you again), there are no top-of-mind <a href="http://mario.nintendo.com/" target="_blank">plumber brands</a> around that people can think of, and there are no communities for people with plumbing needs to talk to each other. This is an excellent environment for all kinds of shady deals. A recent example a friend had to deal with:
<ol>
	<li>Your water heater takes its own life.</li>
	<li>Being a creature of the <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">night</span> internet, you google around for a nice <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ED-209" target="_blank">replacement model</a>.</li>
	<li>You look for a plumber who can deliver and install that replacement model. No helpful plumber reviews online, so you call several and pick one.</li>
	<li>The plumber comes, removes the dead heater and carries it away.</li>
	<li>As he works, he asks innocently why you picked that specific model, and you answer without suspecting anything.</li>
	<li>He goes back to the warehouse to fetch the new model.</li>
	<li>You get a phone call from him, explaining that <em>he's looking at the model right now</em>, and <em>it doesn't have the feature</em> you are looking for. But he has a cheaper model with that feature.</li>
	<li>You agree for the cheaper model to be installed. Unsurprisingly, it <em>sucks</em>.</li>
	<li>You call the maker of the model you initially asked for, and find out it <em>did</em> have that feature.</li>
	<li>The plumber does not return your calls.</li>
</ol>
What probably happened was that the plumber never had the model you were looking for in the first place, so he resorted to bait-and-switch to funnel you into buying the model he did have. Annoying, but clever nonetheless.
