You're saving an important document on your computer and all of a sudden, it explodes. Maybe the power went out, maybe the hard drive joined the choir invisible, or maybe the application just bluescreened. Either way, you lost your work for the past five minutes (because you're hitting <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>S</kbd> every five minutes, <em>right</em>?)

I have some bad news for you: the computer went down while it was writing <em>on top of</em> the file. What used to be a though-provoking bullet-based presentation has now turned into the software equivalent of a week-old roadkill.

In the software industry, we need higher reliability. You don't want your bank to say «y<em>our payment is safe, unless a random crash occurs in the next five minutes</em>», what you expect is nothing less than «s<em>hould the apocalypse strike within the next five seconds, your financial transaction will be safe with us</em>» and this causes us technical types to run around in circles looking for better ways to keep your data crash-proof.

So, obviously, every single database vendor out there advertises itself as being completely and irrevocably crash-proof. Usually as part of a huge bulleted list of features. Boring.

Here, <a href="http://couchdb.apache.org/" target="_blank">CouchDB</a> is the one with the outstanding marketing message. The CouchDB server cannot be shut down by any <em>safe </em>means, the only way to stop it is to cause it to <em>crash </em>(or kill it with a task management tool, or power off the computer). They're basically implying that their crash protection design is so good, crashing the software <em>is </em>the normal shutdown procedure.

<strong>One way to be outstanding is to make difficult things appear effortless — routine events no more remarkable than tying your shoes or drinking water.</strong> Where every other software package makes crash recovery sound like an exceptional effort worthy of being included in a feature list, CouchDB shrugs, an unimpressed «<em>I eat crashes for breakfast</em>» look on its face, and goes back to manhandling your data.

So, what do <em>you</em> eat for breakfast?
