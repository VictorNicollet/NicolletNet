@title White. On Black. 
@draft

A personal pet peeve of mine: people who add captions to images using monochrome text. If you use a white font, then it will be unreadable when it sits on light backgrounds. If you use a black font, then it will be unreadable when it sits on dark backgrounds. Unless your image is exceptionally well-tempered (also known as <em>boring</em>) you will end up with the wrong kind of text sitting on the wrong kind of background and it will look terrible. And if you decide to use two different font colors to handle different backgrounds gracefully, remember that there's nothing graceful about using two different font colors.

What you need is a dark-edged light font (or a light-edged dark font, depending on the effect you wish to achieve). What readers will see is the inner edge between the light center and the dark contour, and that edge is well-preserved regardless of color. For instance:
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.nicollet.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/o-hai-asl.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2092" title="o-hai-asl" src="http://www.nicollet.net/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/o-hai-asl.png" alt="" width="499" height="466" /></a></p>
This can be done in most editing software these days. If you have Office installed, just use the <em>WordArt</em> tool to set a black edge and white body for your font. Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator handle this nicely as well. If you only own free-as-in-beer software, Inkscape allows you to achieve this effect quite easily.

The above image was done with Microsoft PowerPoint 2010, while <a href="http://www.nicollet.net/2010/09/the-outstanding-economy/" target="_blank">this earlier image</a> was done with Inkscape.
