I know you want to start working on your Start-Up right away. Who doesn't? You have a great idea that is bound to earn you millions as soon as it makes it out of your garage, so the obvious choice would be to start working on it immediately. And, as usual, the most obvious choice is probably not the best one.

While it might send you flying into a panic, wasting some time when a project first begins is quite satisfying if you don't let your instincts shame you into regretting it. While I officially started working on <a href="http://www.nicollet.net/2010/10/runorg-aka-muahahaha/" target="_blank">RunOrg</a> this week, one of the first tasks I got out of the way was to finish <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-Life_2" target="_blank">Half-Life 2</a> again in a single session. Needless to say, I was so tired by the end that I was starting to see stupid things:

This is a joke. We don't really support cross-dimensional transhuman dictatorships.  Don't listen to me, I'm just crazy.

Spending one or two weeks doing nothing productive before you start working on that Start-Up has its benefits:
<ul>
	<li>You'll have time to rest and sort your thoughts out. You'll start working with a sharper, fresher mind.</li>
	<li>You can use that time to deal with small forever-postponed details, thus improving marginally your life in the following months: seeing old friends, buying a new shower head, optimizing your bank accounts...</li>
	<li>By the time you're waist-deep into your project, you won't have any regrets about not taking a vacation. If you're anything like me, this is absolute pure gold for your morale.</li>
	<li>A lot of the so-so solutions you thought up before will dissolve into oblivion, to be replaced by better ones later on.</li>
</ul>
Of course, all of this will be for naught if you don't first get rid of that nagging feeling that you should be doing something. Yes, I know your fate and financial independence lies in your hands alone, but that doesn't mean you should rush head first into an uphill battle. A quick vacation improves productivity better than the typical «<em>insert more caffeine</em>» strategy.

Now, if you'll excuse me, there's some <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portal_(video_game)" target="_blank">Cake</a> on my todo-list.
