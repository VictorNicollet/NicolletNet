Need to eat something in Paris? Don't know what a fair price would be? Here are some price guidelines for a small one-person meal:

<ul>
	<li>1.- € : vegan salad</li>
	<li>2.50 € : chicken and pasta</li>
	<li>4.- € : microwave-ready meal</li>
</ul>
Take-away food (you can't sit down)
<ul>
	<li>4.- € : large hot dog or sandwich</li>
	<li>4.50 € : kebab with fries</li>
	<li>4.80 € : <a href="http://www.mezzodipasta.fr/" target="_blank">Mezzo di Pasta</a></li>
	<li>11.- € : pizza deliveries</li>
</ul>
Seated meals (alcohol not included)
<ul>
	<li>6.- € : typical McDonalds menu</li>
	<li>11.- € : average french/chinese/japanese/italian</li>
	<li>16.- € : good french/chinese/japanese/italian</li>
	<li>75.- € : reputable french restaurant</li>
</ul>

Everyone who would launch a new product is aware that they have to know the prices of any competing products. It's hard to set a price appropriately without some knowledge of what other people are doing.

Do you know the price ranges for products that you <em>buy</em>? For products that are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complementary_good" target="_blank">complementary</a> to yours? For products sold by your customers? What channels would you follow to get that information?
