<strong>HTML 5 Advertising</strong>. Many ads these days come as Adobe Flash-based video. Given that Apple still has no plans on providing Flash support on their iPhone or iPad, surely they would look for an alternative solution? It looks like they have: their <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2010/04/08/apple-announces-iad-mobile-advertising-platform/" target="_blank">recently announced mobile advertisment platform</a>, <em>iAd</em>,<em> </em>will provide video ads using HTML 5.

<strong>The Mind as a Security Vulnerability</strong>. The core of every security flaw is an user mistakenly allowing someone to do something unintended. Our inability to know everything or check everything is fundamental here. For instance, we check whether a site we visit is who it pretends to be on the first visit, but not when <a href="http://www.azarask.in/blog/post/a-new-type-of-phishing-attack/" target="_blank">leave the tab and come back</a> to it again. Phishing (and conning) is an interesting form of psychology research : looking for unconscious assumptions about the world.

<strong>The blogger's approach to Privacy.</strong> I blog under my real name. So, don't expect to find on this blog tales of my decadent nights of heavy drinking (assuming for a moment that such nights <em>did</em> exist). I apply the same restraint to all my activities online : whenever I would post something anywhere on the internet, I ask myself whether I would post it on my own blog, so I know I don't have to be afraid of the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2010/05/12/business/facebook-privacy.html">weekly facebook privacy policy changes</a>.

<strong>The ban on laptops.</strong> In an ideal world, only one laptop is allowed in every meeting, and only if there must be some computer-based presentatio involving that laptop. If you have trouble pushing a laptop ban agenda, remember that <a href="Laptops banned in Bhutan assembly over gaming fears" target="_blank">Bhutan did it back in 2008</a>. If a government does it, why shouldn't you?

<strong>Easier Turing Test.</strong> The turing test determines whether an artificial intelligence is sneaky enough to pretend being a human by having a long text-only conversation with an actual human. These days, many data sources aim for quantity instead of quality. How easy is it to have a computer program pretend to be a reputable source of news? <a href="http://snarxiv.org/" target="_blank">SnarXiv</a> already does this for scientific papers, and is nearly undistinguishable from actual <a href="http://arxiv.org/list/astro-ph/new" target="_blank">arXiv</a> listings.
