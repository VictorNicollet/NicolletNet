<strong>The problem:</strong>
<blockquote>Once again, the Evil Overlord is ready to take over the world. His plan involves stealing a nuke, flailing it around wildly like the madman he is, and waiting for all nations to surrender. Igor, his incompetent yet endearing henchman, informs him that the government of Probabilistan has recently built a nuclear silo, cleverly hidden under a soda storage warehouse. The problem is that there are <em>thirty</em> warehouses and the Dark Legions only have enough troops to storm <em>one</em>. Igor can't seem to remember which one it was...

Now, the nice thing about the Probabilistan soda industry is that the supply chain is just flawless. Every day, large numbers of soda bottles are produced in the plant and every bottle will be neatly stored in a single warehouse until the delivery truck comes to take it away. A bottle in warehouse 1 always waits for one day before it's delivered. A bottle in warehouse 2 always waits for two days. A bottle in warehouse N always waits for N days before it's taken away. Every bottle has its manufacturing date clearly printed on its side.

And despite his incompetence, Igor managed to bring back a soda bottle from the very warehouse that sits on top of the silo! But how can a random bottle taken from a random warehouse help the Evil Overlord's scheme? Never underestimate a mad genius!</blockquote>
<strong>The question: </strong>
<blockquote>What is the probability of the Evil Overlord sending his Dark Legions to the correct warehouse?</blockquote>
<strong>Edit (2010/06/26) a few clarifications:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>The Evil Overlord is infinitely intelligent. He knows all of the above, knows the manufacturing date, and will use that data to maximize his chances of finding the correct warehouse. You know neither the location of the nuclear silo, nor the manufacturing date, nor the warehouse that will be attacked (since it probably depends on the manufacturing date anyway).</li>
	<li>Bottles are stored in the warehouses at noon, and also delivered from the warehouses at noon. Igor stole the bottle at midnight (so all storage and deliveries for the day had already taken place).</li>
	<li>Every day, the same number of bottles is produced (several thousands) and split evenly across all warehouses. So, there are no empty warehouses. What "stored in a single warehouse" means is that a given bottle will not be stored in <em>two</em> warehouses.</li>
	<li>Igor took the bottle <em>from</em> the warehouse. So, it was in the warehouse when it was taken.</li>
	<li>Probabilistan isn't a real country.</li>
</ul>

<small>If several people provide the right answer, I will pick one at random using the MD5 hash of their post names and the opening price of the Dow Jones Industrial Average on July 1st 2010, as provided by <a href="http://www.google.com/finance?client=ob&amp;q=INDEXDJX:DJI" target="_blank">Google</a>. If the winner's email is invalid, or if I get no answer within a week, I will pick another winner until I run out of winners, at which point I'll buy myself a book.</small>
