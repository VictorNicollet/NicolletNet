I wish I'd invented <a href="http://www.facebook.com" target="_blank">Facebook</a>. Or <a href="http://www.twitter.com" target="_blank">Twitter</a>. Or <a href="http://www.magentocommerce.com" target="_blank">Magento</a>. Or the <a href="http://www.milliondollarhomepage.com/" target="_blank">Million Dollar Homepage</a>. But now that someone did invent them, there's no point in trying anymore. Right? It's like famous math problems: once someone does prove the Riemann Hypothesis, all the other people working on the topic will need to find another problem to solve. <strong>Once a problem is solved, there's no point in solving it again.</strong>

Or is there? Facebook "replaced" <a href="http://www.techiteasy.org/2006/11/21/bye-bye-friendset/" target="_blank">FriendSet</a> and <a href="http://social.venturebeat.com/2010/01/25/myspace-facebook-nielsen/" target="_blank">MySpace</a>, Magento is still fighting the good fight against <a href="http://blog.templatemonster.com/2010/04/12/magento-beats-oscommerce-comparison-research/" target="_blank">oscommerce</a>. Right now, countless small projects are mustering their feature sets, ready to take on the market leaders. The point is not to topple the titans—the sheer inertia of having to change platforms is going to keep them alive—but rather to chip away some market share.

It's easy to imagine the leading providers as huge ogres and trolls, wielding spiked clubs and crushing you like the little puny ants that you are. Crush, crush, stomp, stomp. You look at their product, and you weep, because there's no way you can have 2000 features done by December, and the big ogre can just imperceptibly nod in the right direction to add all of your features to their solution. Only better, cheaper and shinier.

And it's very tempted to be original (just like everybody else), because there are plenty of examples of start-ups that were doing something completely stupid, yet managed to raise funds and find customers. It's the gold rush mentality all over again: why should I stick around to be a weaver/farmer/carpenter if I can just go to California, where I'm going to pick the river with the gold nuggets, because I'm <em>that</em> good?

Sometimes, it's easier to sneak past the ogre guarding the treasure. Or to stab him in the back.

Here are a few rivers where you might find gold nuggets:
<ul>
	<li><strong>Some people just don't want to go with the mainstream product.</strong> This is the kind of person who would avoid buying an iPhone <em>because everyone else has one</em>. If you're up against an established product, these people can be an interesting market to tap into.</li>
	<li><strong>In expanding markets, you don't need to steal customers</strong>. By extension, if someone <em>just</em> <em>had</em> a great idea, there's still time to jump on the bandwagon: there's plenty of customers for everyone, and your combined efforts will create awareness for the product category.</li>
	<li><strong>No matter what you try, you need to be different.</strong> There are no perfect imitations: customers will find the differences. If they are not intentional, you end up with a product that tries to imitate another, but fails. If you embrace and advertise your differences, you can actually manage to be better than your competitor on a certain topic.</li>
	<li><strong>Nobody's perfect</strong>. Not everyone is a technical genius, a marketing ace and a customer support wizard. Find the weaknesses of your competitors, and determine how you can turn them into advantages for your customers.</li>
	<li><strong>Wait until the time is right</strong>. Quite often, established companies are like frogs in boiling water: they don't notice that the world around them is changing. If several competitors are sitting on a niche activity, they won't necessarily notice right away if that activity gets the spotlight. You might be watching them from the sidelines, waiting to pounce, thereby gaining the advantage by adapting your strategy to the new trend.</li>
	<li><strong>You're someone else</strong>. Every company has an image. Maybe your competitor has a hyper-professional image that appeals only to huge corporations. Maybe they have set up an edgy, cuss-words-on-the-corporate-website kind of show that alienates the more serious customers. If you can manage to be who they are not, you might capture those customers who like the products but hate the shopkeeper.</li>
</ul>
Do you have any interesting experiences to share about moving into a market with established competitor? Do you think is it easier to find a new market, or to find a niche within an existing one?
