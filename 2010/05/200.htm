@title 200

I have written 200 posts since I started this blog back in August 2008. I guess this gives me some bragging rights!

The blog originally started back in 2008 on a <a href="http://www.joomla.org/" target="_blank">Joomla!</a> platform on my shared hosting. The first post, <a href="http://www.nicollet.net/2008/08/options-and-references/" target="_blank">Options and References</a>, was published on August 8th and compared the C++ and Objective Caml approaches to option and reference semantics. I managed to follow a thrice-weekly schedule for a few months, forcing myself to write when I felt tired, which resulted in posts that were sometimes badly formatted or completely uninteresting. There's some serious chaff in those archives, folks.

I started a blog because I was at the time a very active participant on the <a href="http://www.gamedev.net">gamedev.net</a> forums, with several <em>thousand</em> posts under my belt, and many of these were long, in-depth analyses of technical topics. This also helped me improve my english language skills—I'm not a native speaker—and provides me with an invaluable argument in any hiring process. Not bad.

The game development forums were also the reason the blog was written in english : most potential readers at the time were people on the forums, so I had to cater to that audience. It ended up reaching far more people than that, as the blog gradually shifted from a C++/game focus to PHP/JavaScript (and now, to business strategy).

Several blog posts actually come directly from these forums, copy-pasted and quickly edited, and many others were directly inspired from there:

Actually, my 100th post on the blog (it was published on April 1, 2009) was titled <a href="http://www.nicollet.net/2009/04/cpp-confusion/" target="_blank">The C++ hits you! You feel confused.</a> and discussed a common topic found on the forums : should C++ be used as a language to learn game development?

Then, I <a href="http://www.nicollet.net/2008/12/welcome-back/" target="_blank">moved to wordpress</a> in late december 2008. I have had nothing to complain about ever since (well, except comment spam). I have been using K2 as a theme, and modified it last month to <a href="http://www.nicollet.net/2010/04/readability-improvement/" target="_blank">improve the readability</a> of the blog, to add a Retweet button to all my posts, and to append a small 80-day plot of my feed subscribers at the bottom of the right column.
<h3>The Future</h3>
I certainly intend to keep posting here. There has been a gradual increase in readership over these two years, which might be related to my own improvements in both content and style. Besides, there are benefits to blogging (and, in general, to writing down things) : it serves as a log, as a way to think about stuff in greater detail, and as a reassuring routine that just stays there when you change jobs or locations.

I also intend to make a few improvements. These would be:
<ul>
	<li><strong>Add more links.</strong> I believe this is the single greatest offender as far as content is concerned. There's absolutely no way for an average part-time blogger like me to produce as much fresh content as the rest of the internet. This isn't a plan to become an <a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/08/thirteen-blog-cliches.html" target="_blank">echo chamber</a>, but rather a way to add depth to my existing posts. There's a middle ground to be found between the echo chamber blog and the listen-to-me-I'm-interesting blog.</li>
	<li><strong>Add more internal links.</strong> Now that I have two hundred posts, there's absolutely no way for the average reader to skim through the archives to find something of interest. There are so many subjects here that a PHP developer will not care about C++ pointers and a start-up founder will not care about CSS. A short <em>related links</em> section at the bottom of every post should help with this whenever possible.</li>
	<li><strong>Add more images and structure.</strong> Right now, my posts are a neverending wall of text and pain. Adding a few more images, headers and lists back into the fray should help make my posts friendlier.</li>
	<li><strong>Combine several unrelated short posts into one.</strong> Right now, I don't publish an article if it's shorter than 1000 words (or at least, not without painful mental duress), but I have lots of ideas that I could write two or three sentences about. By combining them into longer posts, like Inc.com does (<a href="http://www.inc.com/staff-blog/when-to-say-youre-fired.html" target="_blank">example here</a>), I get to write more, and discuss a larger variety of topics.</li>
</ul>
On the other hand, there will still be no twittering (I have neither the time nor the interest to take care of that).

I hope the improved version will be to your liking. Until then, if you have any advice (or constructive criticism about existing content and practice), feel free to mention it in the comments section!
