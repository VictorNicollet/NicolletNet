@title The right duration
@draft

The basic truth about any activity is that it will always take more time than you have.

Allocating more time to a project does not help : it will just take longer. Reducing the scope of the project does not help : whatever is left will just take longer.

If you have an eight-month milestone, plan for a six-month one and you will get the eight-month release on time. If you have a 10-feature release, plan for a 15-feature release and you will end up with only 10 features anyway.
