Conference speakers usually run in «performance» mode : people paid so that they could listen to them (either with their money or with their free time), and will do so quietly because interrupting the speaker annoys the other listeners.

This means conference speakers can get away with a lot. If they choose to start with facts or anecdotes completely unrelated to the subject, only to find some surprising relationship that comes to the listeners as an epiphany, they can certainly do so because the listeners are paying attention and are actively looking for that hidden relationship. If they choose a presentation structure that starts with the details and waits a few minutes before introducing the bigger picture, they can do so because the listeners are focused and will commit most of the details to memory as they are described.

They are performers. You don't interrupt a tech conference speaker to ask «what about OpenID?» for the same reasons that you don't interrupt the Rolling Stones to ask «hey, could you play Angie instead?»

When giving out a presentation at a meeting, you are not acting as a performer. You might have a lot of things to say about the new merger, and you might have crafted an elegant presentation, and you might have great speaking skills, but a typical meeting has no rules against interrupting the speaker to ask a question.

Joe from accounting is bored because he does not really care about how retailers will be trained after the merger or where the new computer center will be, and he is scared because the merger might mean more work for him, or moving to an office on the other side of town, or being terminated, or whatever else it is that accountants fear.

So, the moment you say something, <em>anything</em>, that might be tangentially related to his interests, Joe will interrupt you and ask a valid question about it, trying to drag your presentation over to his territory. Even if you shut Joe up immediately, the rest of the audience will lose their focus, making the rest of the presentation harder to grasp.

Of course, it might be better if meetings were <em>meetings</em> instead of conference talks in disguise. But sometimes, meetings are one-sided simply because one side has all the information and the other side has none, and there's almost no polite way of saying «we know everything, so we'll do the talking and you'll do the nodding» so people mitigate and say instead «there's something we need to discuss and act upon» and this leaves the door open to, well, <em>discussion</em>.

Where conference speakers can focus on giving an elegant presentation that drives a point home by creating the appropriate emotional connection or state of mind, a meeting speaker needs to give sturdy presentations that can survive several interruptions by people who don't actually care. If possible, they should actually look for ways to make their presentation <em>harder to interrupt</em>, by not giving anyone in the room an inch to stray from the topic.

How?
<h4>1. Intimidate your audience.</h4>
Not the muscle-flexing, whip-cracking kind of intimidation, of course. Overt intimidation breeds hostility, but you can apply subtle intimidation for perfectly good reasons.

You could do the meeting on your own premises : your building, your floor, your department. This is especially effective if the audience comes from several geographically remote locations.

Invite people who don't know each other so that they will stay quiet through peer pressure. If you can, also select personality types who listen before they talk back.

Tell the audience ahead of time that the meeting will be very important, preferably through unofficial communication channels : an «IMPORTANT» e-mail with tens of recipients has less impact than a quick one-on-one «by the way, that's a very important meeting, I really hope you'll be there» in a hallway.

The layout of the meeting room is important. Round table layouts place everyone on the same level, while classroom layouts put an emphasis on the speaker. If possible, stay between the audience and the board or screen.
<h4>2. Architecture your presentation as short, simple, independent bursts.</h4>
Conference speakers have the leisure to use a long, uninterrupted time span as they wish. As a meeting speaker, if you are interrupted in the middle of a critical ten-minute explanation, you might as well go home.

Unless you're very good, or your audience is very good, you <em>will</em> be interrupted. Once the interruption has been dealt with, you go back to driving your points home, so you want to make that as simple as possible.

Short explanations that fit on one <em>short</em> slide are great, because you can easily start over again.

Simple explanations are even better, because if the interruption was short enough, you can simply go back to what you were saying without having to repeat yourself.

Independent explanations help the audience catch up if they every get lost. If slide N is a prerequisite to understanding slide N+1, you will lose more people with each slide.
<h4>3. Be honest : start with the One Slide.</h4>
If you want questions to be asked <em>after</em> the presentation, say so. People will be reasonable if you keep your presentation short. If you think a particular section is critical, say so right before you start talking about it. The audience will stay focused for a short while. Honesty helps, but there's more to it.

If you've done meetings before, you know what the One Slide is. It's the slide you fast-forward to when someone in the audience asks a question that's a bit off-topic, and you need to show them a summary graph of what you're doing. When Joe asks about the work load in accounting, you fast forward to the summary slide that shows the various topics in your talk, and the accounting work load is in there, <em>and you just hadn't reached it yet</em>. Or perhaps your talk is about retail training and that question from Joe is completely off topic, so you show him a slide with the list of topics.

But it's too late. Joe doesn't read your mind. Fast-forwarding to the One Slide is a sign of failure.

The One Slide doesn't have to be a summary, or a graph, or anything. What it does is explain the rules of the presentation : this is <em>what</em> we talk about, this is <em>when</em> we talk about it. After seeing the One Slide, anyone in the audience should be able to tell whether topic X will be discussed and when. The shape is irrelevant, what is important is that the rules are conveyed.

A common mistake is to believe that an outline of the presentation is enough. It might be, but only if it is very precise about what will be discussed. Vagueness undermines the authority of the One Slide, because it makes the rules feel optional. A section called «Technical Considerations» is an invitation to people asking questions about practical considerations you never dreamed of. «IT Case Study» is better because it's not as open-ended and actually only relates to IT. «Legacy Mainframe Integration Schedule» means if they're not asking about the schedule for integrating the legacy mainframe, they shouldn't be asking at all.

<strong>Quick tip</strong>: if you have trouble describing your rules in the One Slide, maybe you should focus your presentation more, or look for simpler ways of presenting it.
<h4>4. Make interruptions happen when you want them to happen.</h4>
Questions tend to be asked when the audience thinks the speaker is done and is doing a short pause, or when the question is about to become off-topic. With this in mind, one can identify vulnerable spots in a presentation:
<ul>
	<li>Questions about a slide will be asked on the next slide.</li>
	<li>Questions about a section will be asked when that section ends.</li>
	<li>If there are several speakers, questions will be asked when the speaker changes.</li>
	<li>«Are there any questions?»</li>
</ul>
This should help you identify where you are likely to be interrupted, so that you may avoid them in tight spots where a focused audience is important. You can eliminate some of these vulnerable spots! For instance, while speaker A may introduce speaker B, he should not introduce speaker B's <em>topic</em>: this just begs for questions about the topic, and it is very annoying to start one's part of a presentation with questions.

If an explanation is complex, spread it over several slides so that no single slide will be so complex as to bring up questions when it's done.

Make sure none of your transitions within sections feel like transitions <em>between</em> sections.

Defuse any potential surprise questions by asking, in spots where you know questions can't hurt, whether the audience has any questions.
