When you visit a web site, that web site remembers your request, along with some information about that request. Here's some data that the Apache web server remembers:
<ul>
	<li>217.111.148.194 : your IP address</li>
	<li>[26/Apr/2010:13:02:15 +0200] : when you visited</li>
	<li>GET <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T-TA57L0kuc">/ladies/naughty.avi</a> : what you asked for.</li>
	<li>https://www.facebook.com : the page where you found the link to the current page</li>
	<li>Mozilla/5.0 : your browser</li>
	<li>Windows NT 6.0 : your operating system</li>
</ul>
It is of course possible to eliminate most of that information (only the first three are required). It is the fourth, however, that can cause havoc: people know where you come from.

Consider now what would happen if your corporation uses some kind of webmail. Something like <code>http://mail.google.com/a/<strong>myCompany</strong></code><strong> </strong>or <code>http://intranet.<strong>myCompany</strong>.com/zimbra</code>. Suppose that one of your co-workers send you an e-mail about a new feature from your competitor that you absolutely have to see. In that e-mail is a link. You click on the link.

Since the e-mail was displayed as a web page in your web browser, its address will be sent to your competitor's server. Now your competitor knows that your company is exchanging mails about their latest feature.

Some web mailers protect you against this. Check it out.
