Updated the stylesheet for the blog today to increase readability:
<ul>
	<li>Decreased the size of the header, which used valuable screen real estate, from 220 pixels to 70 pixels. In terms of screen size, it decreased from 1/3rd of the screen height down to 1/9th.</li>
	<li>Increased the width from 750 to 960 pixels (all of that increase went into making the content column wider).</li>
	<li>Increased the font size by a few percent, and reduced the line height a bit.</li>
	<li>Restored sane colors for the links (blue by default, orange when visited).</li>
	<li>Corrected some silly rules (such as strong text using a different font, code being larger than the rest of the line, and the extreme line height in pre blocks).</li>
</ul>
Hopefully, it should be easier to read.
