@title Fast Learners

Slow learners need weeks of training and years of practice to become skilled in their area of expertise. Fast learners «<em>get it</em>» within days, and become fully operational within weeks. Intelligence is certainly a factor, but it does not matter as much as one would expect.

How fast is a given person going to relate new concepts to her experience? Is she going to sift through all the feedback she gets, positive or negative, for lessons or ideas? Faced with new responsibilities, is she going to try something, <em>anything at all</em>, or freeze in fear because of the possible consequences? Does she think about the issue at all between 6pm and 9am? Is she going to repeat the same mistakes twice? Does she think everything is fine when everything is <em>not</em> fine?

But being a fast learner is a skill that is hard to demonstrate. You can demonstrate great skill with a programming language by single-handedly writing an open source program, you can demonstrate great leadership or management skills by successfully leading several teams and managing several projects, and you can demonstrate great artistic skills with a well-stocked portfolio, because these skills work on the basis of «<em>if you did it ten times, you can do it eleven times</em>»

By definition, you cannot learn the same thing ten times in a row, and saying that you will learn how to <strong>manage a team</strong> in two weeks because you learned how to <strong>code in PHP</strong> in two weeks is a bit of a stretch. It's very hard to determine in a single job interview how fast someone can learn about new subjects. Once you hire someone and get the chance to work with them for a short while, though, you <em>should</em> be able determine this.

Otherwise, there's no telling where that person will be a few months from now. And that would be bad management.
