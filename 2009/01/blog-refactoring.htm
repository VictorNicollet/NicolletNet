The old categories of "Functional Tuesdays", "Dynamic Wednesdays" and "Imperative Fridays" are getting increasingly restrictive, mostly because they were though out quite quickly when I first started my blog five months ago. The main problem is that, while I do have things to talk about, quite often it's a matter of one category being full of ideas and the other empty (with the inspirational category changing over time). This has obvious effects:
<ul>
	<li>I don't have an excellent idea for a column, so I'll write a short article on an idea that's good, but not awesome.</li>
	<li>I can't stay passionate about a topic for weeks, nor can I write everything in advance and still manage to fill the less passionate columns in time, which means a lot of ideas are just thrown away because they don't fit my publishing schedule.</li>
</ul>
Another reason why I'm giving up on these is that <strong>Wordpress seems to have wiped away all my categories</strong>. There are no more categories either on the public website or in the back-office, and I won't be hunting for them in the code or database anytime soon.

Also, I won't be changing the regular schedule: Tuesday, Wednesday and Friday remain fixed publishing days, although if I have too many things to say, I will add them anywhere during the week. This way I still have a quantity constraint (or else I won't get anything done) and the fixed days will prevent me from writing the articles in a single sunday evening rush.
