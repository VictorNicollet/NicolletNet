@title Bored CSS
@draft

I had some free time on my lunch hour today, so I decided to answer <a href="http://www.gamedev.net/community/forums/topic.asp?topic_id=538263" target="_blank">a plea for help on the GameDev.net forums</a>.
<blockquote>I am absolutely horrible with CSS. I need something to launch my site with (server is not available ATM)

If you can make this page look presentable i'll be very happy. Please build on each other work so instead of msging me paste a link in the thread so everyone can see what you done and hopefully make it better.</blockquote>
It took me a few minutes to review the page structure, think of a classic left-right page structure, and write the corresponding CSS. I didn't have a lot of time, so I couldn't make the stylesheet fully portable (for instance, the rounded corners only work in Firefox, and some CSS selectors seem to confuse Internet Explorer) thus illustrating the classic conundrum that designing the stylesheet is 99% of the work, and making the stylesheet work across all browsers is the remaining 99% of the work.

And then there's the 99% of adding jQuery to the page ;)

You can check out <a href="http://www.nicollet.net/files/bored" target="_blank">the re-designed page</a>, or look at this screenshot to see what it looks like in my FireFox:
