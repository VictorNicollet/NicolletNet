It's virtually impossible to visit every page of a website (well, except for very small websites). And until you try to visit a page or use a feature, you don't know whether that feature works or not—that's why testing software in general is so hard. You can't really know if you're visiting a cardboard town until you've visited everything.

For instance, there's an MP3 download website called gomar-krakow.com (I'm not making the link clickable) that looks quite professional. That is, until you read the privacy policy :
<blockquote><strong>The Way, what We Use This Information:</strong>

The philosophical implications of their poetry are quite moving. And the terms of use page is even worse:
<blockquote><strong>Notice</strong>:  Trying to get property of non-object in <strong>/usr/home/gomar/domains/domain/public_html/templates/mp3-archive/static.tpl</strong> on line <strong>3</strong>

It seems pretty obvious that those nice shiny "Terms of use" and "Privacy policy" links one very single page are there to provide the illusion of a professional website, even if clicking on them dispels that illusion quite fast.

The same happens when you try to download a product, as a captcha comes up and never registers your input. The whole deal looks suspiciously like a way to extract captcha recognition from clueless humans without anything in return.

As a web designer, recognize that humans are intrinsically shallow, and make sure that you provide the impression of a complete and professional website—just packing functionality together isn't enough, you have to make it <em>look</em> complete.

As an user, realize that most people who have something to sell already know that cognitive flaw of yours and exploit it to the fullest, and make sure to explore everything just a little bit further to look for inconsistencies or missing pieces before you commit money to a product.
