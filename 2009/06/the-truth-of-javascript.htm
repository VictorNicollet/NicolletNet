nFriedly posted an interesting refresher on JavaScript boolean evaluation of non-boolean values : <a href="http://nfriedly.com/techblog/2009/06/advanced-javascript-operators-and-truthy-falsy/" target="_blank">Logical Operators and Truthy / Falsy</a>.

It's worth mentioning that JavaScript evaluates empty arrays as "true", whereas PHP evaluates them as "false".
