Jamin-Puech is a French company that designs and sells handbags and jewelry worldwide. Still, people couldn't buy these handbags online, because the brand had no e-commerce website.

It consists mostly of a custom-skinned <a href="http://www.magentocommerce.com">Magento</a> website with some additional development in various functionality areas.

The result has been online for a short while now. If you're interested in handbags:
