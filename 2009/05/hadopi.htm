The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HADOPI_law" target="_blank">HADOPI law</a> was recently adopted by the French parliament. I have an issue with this law: it deals with technical things that few people are knowledgeable in (including most members of parliament) such as the Internet Protocol and the use of IP addresses.

So, I have made a small effort on this website to explain <a href="/useless/hadopi">the basic technical principles underlying the HADOPI law</a> [fr].
