My employer, Tangane, has recently opened a <a href="http://blog.tangane.com" target="_blank">corporate blog</a> [fr]. I will be one of the editors, so expect to find articles from me regularly—the target audience is not as technical as the one for my own blog, so the posts will probably be more about general considerations and strategy in IT.
