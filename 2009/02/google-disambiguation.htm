@title Google Disambiguation
@draft

Right now, every name on the web can be owned by only a handful of entities. Sure, you can play around with registering only one of ".com", ".net", ".org" (and ".fr", and ".biz", and so on) and letting other entities have the other domain names. But seriously, what large company today would not consider registering all of the top-level domains that it can get away with, along with national top-level domains?

So, what will happen when there won't be enough names anymore? The good news is that Wikipedia solved that problem already: when several things have the same name (as often happens in real-life), Wikipedia provides a disambiguation page that allows choosing between the various options in a short and concise manner. How long until the leading web authorities incorporate a disambiguation scheme to let users choose between several options that all have the same domain name? It would certainly take some effort to get right (the entire DNS system would probably have to be re-hauled) but with Facebook getting control of the mail system and Stack Overflow eating up Usenet simultaneously it shouldn't really be a problem. Would it?

Ha ha, only serious.
