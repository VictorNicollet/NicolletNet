I have recently contributed two articles to two game development books.

These are:
<ul>
	<li><strong>Difficulty in Dexterity-Based Platform Games</strong>,

	<li><strong>Item Management Systems</strong>,
in <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Design-Content-Creation-GameDev-net-Collection/dp/1598638084" target="_blank"><em>Beginning Game Programming</em></a> (ISBN 1-59863-805-X)</li>
</ul>
Both are in the <a href="http://www.gamedev.net" target="_blank">gamedev.net</a> collection.
