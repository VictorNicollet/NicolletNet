@title Happy Birthday, Pizza!

A year ago, I ordered a €9 pizza from Speed Rabbit Pizza, a Paris-based pizza delivery chain. A meal was had by me. Verily.

The next evening, I received a text message on my cell phone about a promotional 3-for-2 offer from that very Speed Rabbit Pizza outlet. I had made the mistake of giving them my cell phone number, because they wanted to call me if the pizza delivery man got stuck in a door. I have been receiving such weekly reminder messages every week for an entire year . And since they also had my home address, they could even send me promotional envelopes by mail.

I am quite protective of my personal contact information, and actively avoid doing business with any company that contacts me without my permission, so I have taken my business to Pizza Hut instead.

Total money made by Speed Rabbit pizza from me: <strong>€8.53</strong> (without tax)

Total money spent by Speed Rabbit pizza on sending me promotional messages: 52&nbsp;×&nbsp;€0.07&nbsp;(text&nbsp;messages)&nbsp;+&nbsp;5&nbsp;×&nbsp;€0.7&nbsp;(postal&nbsp;mail) = <strong>€7.14</strong> (without tax)

Total money earned by Pizza Hut because Speed Rabbit sent me promotional messages: around <strong>€105</strong> (without tax)
