Some of you may have wondered, <em>what is this secret project he is working on</em>?

The project is called JITBrain. In itself, it's nothing quite groundbreaking, merely an issue tracking platform that services two categories of users:
<ul>
	<li>Individuals that have a lot to do but never seem to manage it. These are helped by features such as extremely simple todo-list manipulation, a search engine for looking at previous tasks and retrieving important information, and helpful statistics.</li>
	<li>Teams that must collaborate on projects. These are helped by features such as issue tracking, simple workflows, attached links and files, planning poker, reporting charts, and motivational gizmos.</li>
</ul>
The unusual thing about the project is the development method: it builds upon my earlier ramblings on snippet-oriented development (developing quality software by actively thinking of the people who will read and reuse the code) to actually become an advanced tutorial in itself. This brings yet another benefit, since the code is not only designed in short bursts of concisely explained functionality, but a complete documentation and log is being written along with it.

As such, it has the additional purpose of serving as a simple reference for "classic mistakes" both in technical and functional areas in the development of a website.

The tutorial advances along with the development of the system, which means you can <a href="./jitbrain">see the tutorial</a> or <a href="http://jitbrain.nicollet.net" target="_blank">look at the website</a>.
