@title JavaScript RGB Password

<a href="https://github.com/skattyadz/JavaScript-RGB-Password" target="_blank">This</a> (demo <a href="http://skattyadz.github.com/JavaScript-RGB-Password/index.html" target="_blank">here</a>) displays a fingerprint of your hidden password using three color boxes, so you can <em>see</em> if it is correct.

My first reaction was «Nice, I wonder what my usual passwords look like.» My second reaction was «I should fork this and AJAX all the passwords to my server»

Does that make me innately evil ?
