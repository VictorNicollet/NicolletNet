On my previous article about cold calling, Stu Millett left an <a href="http://www.nicollet.net/2012/03/of-cold-calling-and-other-trolls/comment-page-1/#comment-291281">interesting comment</a>. The relevant parts are :
<blockquote>If i want something i will go look for it, if i don’t find your product- tuff! If you go out of business, tuff because you had a rubbish business plan, specialised product with limited appeal or whatever- your product is not good enough!

[...]

Pull your head out your arse will you! Cold callers are the scum of the earth and so are their advocates! Retailers are scum too but at least i get the choice or opening the conversation or not!</blockquote>
I wish to thank Stu for his kind words and interesting comments about my anatomy. But, more seriously, I sincerely wish my customers were like him. Wait, let me rephrase that. <strong>I wish all humans were like Stu Millett</strong>.

This is what we all expect humans to do when solving problems : research the issue, examine the solutions and pick the best one. If you're not being picked, it <em>must</em> be because your product sucks.

Such an analysis is correct for <strong>wedding planners</strong>. Every year, there's a crowd of young couples who never needed to plan a wedding before. The only course of action for them is to research possible options, which provides wedding planners with a constant flow of potential customers that they have to convince based on the merits of their product.

It does not apply, however, to <strong>hairdressers</strong>. When you set up shop, all the people in your area have already finished their search for a hairdresser. This is not a product issue : even if your skills and your pricing are a clear improvement over the competition, your potential customers are not looking for a hairdresser anymore, and so you will never have a chance to compete in the first place.

If a new hairdresser appeared in your town and offered better haircuts at a lower price, how long would it take you to notice ?

Your strategy is going to be entirely different based on whether you're selling a wedding planner or hairdresser product. Wedding planners have to spend most of their resources on being easy to find and easy to compare. Hairdressers have to spend most of their resources telling their potential customers that there's a new player on the field.

The worst possible mistake you could do here is this :
<blockquote><em>«Our product is unique, there's no entrenched competition, we are obviously wedding planners.»</em></blockquote>
Let me make this clear : being a wedding planner or a hairdresser is not about what your product is, it's about the pain it solves. If you're solving a pain that a lot of people experience for the first time, then you're a wedding planner. Otherwise, you're a hairdresser.

And guess what ? I made that mistake. Our product makes group managers so awesome at managing groups, I thought, that most of our target market will agree we're the best. So we designed a wedding planner release, and watched quietly as... nobody ever came.

Group managers are not idiots. They know they have group management problems, and they have already looked for solutions years ago. Most of the time, these solutions are contraptions made of mailing-lists, online forums, Microsoft Excel spreadsheets and random pieces of string ; they are frustrating to use and cause many problems of their own, from lost data to people not receiving important messages to privacy issues, but that's not enough to cause group managers to start looking for other solutions.

In the words of Stu, is our product <em>«not good enough»</em> ? No. Every time we have shown our product to a potential customer, they have loved it, and they even told their friends about it. This is not a product problem. Then did we have a <em>«rubbish business plan»</em> ? We most certainly did!

Our real challenge is not to convince people we're the best, but to tell as many people as possible that there's a new hairdresser in town.

As I mentioned previously, there are three ways of doing that : word-of-mouth, advertising and direct contact. Depending on your target population, one of these solutions is going to be better than the others. Direct contact may be the scum of the earth, it may be extremely annoying to many people, but that doesn't make it a bad marketing strategy.
