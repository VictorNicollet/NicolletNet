There's a small shitstorm blowing around on Hacker News right now. The back story is that Dustin Curtis created <a href="http://dcurt.is/codename-svbtle" target="_blank">svbtle</a>, a blogging platform that is currently closed-source and invite-only. A relevant bit:
<blockquote><small>I wrote this engine entirely for myself, without the intention of opening it up to other people. But since realizing that it has improved the way I think and write, I've decided to open it up to a small number of vetted bloggers. At least at first. The goal is simple: when you see the Svbtle design, you should know that the content is <em>guaranteed</em> to be great. Network bloggers are encouraged to keep quality high at the expense of everything else.</small></blockquote>
Then, Nate Wienert created <a href="http://natewienert.com/codename-obtvse" target="_blank">obtvse</a>, intended to be an open-source alternative to Dustin's svbtle software.
<blockquote><small>So, I decided to do something about it. Svbtle was nearly exactly what I had been looking to do with my own blog. I wanted it, and I wanted to share it with friends. I whipped open terminal, typed in <em>rails new obtvse</em>, and a few hours later I'm here.</small></blockquote>
Then, Nate posted the link on Hacker News, and the <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3744294" target="_blank">top comment</a> came from Dustin:
<blockquote><small>This is almost unbelievable. No matter what you think about me or my product decisions, it is flatly wrong to ripoff work. It's shameful, even.</small>

<small>Please take this site down and delete the Github repository. The work isn't yours.</small>

<small>Just wait until Svbtle is finished and open to the public. The reason it's closed is really simple: it's not ready yet.</small></blockquote>
Let's get a few facts straight before we go on.
<ol>
	<li>Nate Wienert did not copy any source code from Svbtle when creating Obtvse. The implementation of Obtvse is an entirely original work, <em>including the HTML and CSS</em>.</li>
	<li>The function and underlying idea of the Obtvse <em>software</em> are exactly the same as those of Svtble <em>software</em>.</li>
	<li>The design and features of Obtvuse, though not identical, are strikingly similar to Svbtle, and this is intentional.</li>
</ol>
What happened ?

<strong>Nate owns the implementation work for Obtvse</strong>. He wrote it himself, and it bears no significant resemblance to the implementation of Svbtle. Dustin has no business telling anyone else what to do with the code they write.

<strong>No one owns the general idea behind the software</strong>: less clutter ? Emphasis on content instead of presentation ? Markdown ? None of these are original, and if they were, then 2007 called : the people at Tumblr want their ideas back.

<strong>The design and features are more of a gray area</strong>. Creating an aesthetically pleasing design is more difficult than turning that design into HTML and CSS. The original Obtvse was indeed dangerously close to plagiarism, but has moved away from the original Svbtle design and is looking for its own visual identity.

So, is Dustin entitled to complain about the situation ? I believe so.

<strong>Obtvse is blatantly hijacking the Svtble brand</strong>. But first, let me mention <a href="http://zachholman.com/posts/from-hack-to-popular-project/" target="_blank">an article written last year</a> by Zach Holman :
<blockquote><small>Last Monday, I sat down to hack.</small>

<small>After a few hours, I open sourced the code. By the end of the week, it had 1,000 watchers and 70 forks on GitHub, and 500 upvotes on Hacker News.</small>

<small> </small><small></small><small>It’s my favorite example of open source recently. Here’s why it worked.</small></blockquote>
He then explains that his project took off because it was easily portable, simple and fun. No. These certainly helped a little bit, but the main reason the project had a massive audience is because Zach Holman has a massive audience : he has a popular blog that is regularly seen on Hacker News, he is followed by ten thousand people on Twitter and he works at GitHub. In fact, I would be quite interested in the following experiment : create a new blog, new twitter account and new GitHub profile, publish an awesome project and see how long it takes to get 1,000 watchers !

I'm not saying that Zach Holman was lucky. Quite the contrary : building an audience takes time and effort, and I'm quite certain that Zach earned  every single one of his feed subscribers and twitter followers.

Which brings me back to Svbtle and Obtvse. I may disagree with the «Invite-Only Network» mostly out of jealousy for not being able to join, but I will be the first to agree that <strong>Dustin Curtis worked hard to build the personal audience that he could pitch Svbtle to</strong>. The main reason why Nate Wienert rose to the top of Hacker News is that it's a different take on a well-known and trending topic — in all honesty, if you had never heard of Svbtle in the first place, would you have paid any attention to Obtvse ?

And this is unfair. It's unfair to Dustin, who worked hard on getting people to know Svbtle and is being painted as a bad guy because of what is ultimately an emotional reaction that should not have been posted. And it's unfair to all of us who would rather be acknowledged because of who we are instead of what bandwagon we rode on.
