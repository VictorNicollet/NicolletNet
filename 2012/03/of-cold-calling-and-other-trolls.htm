<blockquote>This should go without saying, but don’t cold call or spam me. If your product is good and meets my needs, I promise that I’ll find out about it.</blockquote>
I call bullshit on this one. Not the « no cold calls or spam » part, of course (those are an absolute pain) but rather the « I will find it » promise.

<strong>You will not find my product ...</strong>

Because, maybe my product is solving a need that you don't know you have. Perhaps it's a pain that you have come to accept as a natural part of life, and you wouldn't expect a solution to exist. If you already have a working thermostat in your house, how likely are you to search for a better one — and discover <a href="http://www.nest.com/" target="_blank">that Nest solves your user interface pains</a> ?

Or maybe your needs may look vaguely similar to a problem you have solved in the past, so you will use the same solution as before instead of doing a brand new search for new solutions. You need to split expenses for a party, and you know a Google Docs form would solve the problem, so you don't bother looking for anything else and never discover <a href="http://splitwise.com/" target="_blank">more adapted solutions, such as Splitwise</a>.

<strong>... so I need to reach you. </strong>

There are many ways of doing that — ads, social marketing, press releases, viral features, cold calling — and depending on the product and the target audience, some of them may work better than others. Yes, it's possible for cold calling or mass e-mailing to achieve better results than all other techniques combined.

As surprising as it may seem, my startup has achieved the best results by calling or e-mailing people directly: we reached more people, we had a better conversion rate, and we had higher profits.

<strong>Am I suggesting cold calls or spam?</strong>

Kind of. The situation is far from black-and-white.

At the white end of the continuum, I know with perfect accuracy whether my product meets your needs. Maybe you posted about it on your blog, or mentioned it at a conference, or one of your friends tweeted about it. I can call you and say « Sir, I've noticed that you are looking for a Frobnicator, and we happen to be the only Frobnicator providers in your area. » and to you, this will not feel like a cold call, it will feel like someone paying attention to you.

At the black end of the continuum, I have no idea who you are or what you want. I can call you and say « Insert name here, would you like to purchase life insurance for your pet goldfish? » and your pet goldfish died last week and you burst into tears on the phone and curse me and my kin for seven generations.

The question is, where do we draw the line? How qualified do your leads need to be before you contact them directly? And if the leads are qualified enough, why are we not calling them?
