<small>Of course the easy and realistic answer to my question is: finish your studies, do a PhD, start an academic career and when your research brings you an awesome and marketable idea, launch your startup.</small>

<small>But that means maybe launching a startup almost ten years from now, at least. And I must admit that some times I want to live the startup adventure right now, without waiting. When I want that, I'm never stopped by missing startup ideas, I already had plenty of that. What's missing is the courage to jump and go for it without knowing what happens if it fails, because I haven't finished my studies yet. That's an horrible feeling. We people of my generation, at least in France (Europe?), have a lot of pressure about that. We feel like any wrong move will lead us to life-long unemployment and misery. I'm of course exaggerating a little, but you get the idea.</small></blockquote>

Alone, humans have a lot of trouble merely surviving, let alone leading a modern life with its plentiful food, high-speed internet, health benefits, cell phones and MP3 music. <strong>Your main priority as a human being is to get help from other human beings.</strong> The most common way of doing this is by helping <em>them</em> in return for money, and use that money to buy help from others. Being an employee, a freelancer or an investor are three kinds of help you can offer, each with its own risks and rewards, but ultimately it does not matter.

<strong>The single most important skill in modern society is convincing people to accept your help for a good fee</strong>. From my experience, young people in general and those with a technical expertise in particular, do not have this skill. They naturally seek out careers where this skill is not necessary: obtaining several degrees (which involves mostly their technical expertise, and makes it easier to convince people to accept their help) and settling on a job that is as stable as possible so they get a maximum bang for the proverbial buck they spent during the recruitment process. 

The pressure you describe as &laquo;any wrong move [...] life-long unemployment&raquo; is a consequence of your lack of skill in getting money from people : you need to spend most of your time building up powerful arguments (good degrees, a brilliant yet <em>consensual</em> early career) to compensate for it. It is hardly surprising that any such argument you fail to build up feels like a setback for your future career.  

The secret is that this getting-money-from-people skill can be trained: try spending one day each week with a different recruitment officer, and after a while, you will start to get the hang of it. Once you've went through enough interviews that you feel you could get a soulless but high-paying job on a whim, you will feel a lot safer. 

Another thing: this skill can be supplemented by things that are neither degrees nor traditional career moves. The very act of founding and sticking with a startup, even if it ultimately failed, is a strong selling point because it says a lot about your ability to function autonomously. Reputation, such as being a known speaker to trade conferences or writing an expert blog on a given topic, is also a great way to convince people. Networking means you can be on the receiving end of an &laquo;I know a guy who knows a guy&raquo; recommendation, and the act of stepping outside of your social comfort zone is in itself a refreshing activity.  

Obviously, having an original early career will make it hard for you to work as a corporate drone. Corporate drones are chosen for their blandness, predictability and lack of surprises, and startup founders are the opposite of all three. So you won't get a job as a corporate drone. Boo hoo. But many companies, including mine, actually enjoy original profiles [2]. 

But, and here's the funny part: <strong>you can never build a successful startup if you don't have mad getting-money-from-people skills</strong>. Building a working product is the easy part, especially for technical founders like us, but you won't sell it, you won't get investors to fund you, and you won't convince the mythical &laquo;sales co-founder&raquo; to join your team. So, if you're not ready to brush up on those skills, don't even think of creating a startup. You may certainly join one that already has a competent evangelist on board, but there's a high risk that it will feel like you're working on someone else's project. 

Before I go, one final thing about startups. Your &laquo;what if I fail ?&raquo; makes absolutely no sense. Your startup will fail. Probably several times, in fact. The beauty of startups is that failure is not permanent: you've discovered one way that doesn't work, so pivot the hell out of your business model and try another approach. As long as you keep working on it, there's no definite point in time where your startup will be objectively and irrevocably dead. <strong>And that's the hardest part about a startup: the only way it can die is if you kill it.</strong> [3] If you stop the &laquo;okay, one more try and then I give up&raquo; game and accept to live forever with the crushing suspicion that one more try would have made it work. 

<strong>This, in itself, is a lot more painful than the fear you won't ever find a paying job again.</strong>
