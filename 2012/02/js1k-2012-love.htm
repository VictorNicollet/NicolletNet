@draft

<a href="http://js1k.com/" target="_blank">js1k</a> is a competition that runs once or twice a year. The point is to write a piece of JavaScript that is shorter than 1024 characters (<em>bytes</em>, actually, so mind your encoding) and still manages to do something interesting and somehow related to the subject of the competition.

It performs a simulation of a 50%-male, 50%-female population (entirely heterosexual — I couldn't fit anything else in those 1k bytes) of things that bounce around a room and enter variable-duration relationships whenever opposite gender couples collide. A pie chart in the top left corner displays the current proportions of single males and females.
