I understand that efforts to add Creation Science or Intelligent Design to the curriculum of U.S. schools have been repeatedly thwarted in recent years. You blamed the atheists and the God-haters, the heathens and the hypocrites.

For the sake of discussion, let us assume that truth may only be found within your version of the Holy Bible — however unfair it may be to members of other religions — including, of course, that God does indeed exist as described therein.

As you might know, the Genesis describes how the Lord created everything. The most well-known quote from the Holy Bible is probably this :
<blockquote>And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.</blockquote>
This answers the question « Why is there light ? » that, quite shockingly, secular science never considered interesting enough to ponder. Indeed, secular science instead concentrates on more empirical questions such as « How does light behave ? » — answered in part by the laws of Maxwell — or « Is light a special case of a more general phenomenon ? » — which is indeed the case, as visible light is made of the same <em>stuff</em> as X-rays or radio waves.

In a sense, secular scientists do have a point : questions such as « How does it behave ? » give us the ability to predict the behavior of things, which is essential in order to build tools or technology. Understanding the wave-like behaviour of light, for instance, is essential to building lasers, which in turn enable us to have DVD players and eye surgery. Questions such as « Why does it exist ? » have no such practical application, unless the answer covers both <em>Why</em> and <em>How</em>.

As such, « Light exists because God created it » is of no practical or scientific use — it is, by definition, a small bit of trivia : true, but useless for anything but the sake of knowledge. Then again, knowledge begets knowledge : if the information contained within the Holy Bible is true, why are we not using it as a starting point for increasing our knowledge of the universe ?

For instance, we know from the Bible that God <em>said</em>, Let there be light.

<strong>What language did He speak</strong> <strong>?</strong> Was it one of the early semitic languages, such as those that transmitted the early versions of the Bible through oral tradition ? If that were the case, linguists worldwide would be thrilled to learn that a language from the afro-asiatic family existed before humans were around to speak it. Or was it something else entirely ?

In that case, <strong>what were the exact words He used ?</strong> Could we use them to infer the vocabulary and grammar of that language ? How would it relate to modern or ancient languages ?

We know that the words carried the power to create light, but <strong>was the power within the words or did it come from God ?</strong> If it was within the words, could we harness words of power ourselves, perhaps by emulating the anatomical characteristics God used to speak them ? If not, why were words necessary and what does this tell us about the interaction between words and power ?

These are just elementary questions related to a single sentence in the Holy Bible, and they are not directly answered therein. Finding the answers would greatly further our understanding of our word, and have great practical applications. Why are we not working on these questions ?

<strong>Because we can't.</strong>

All the supernatural aspects of the Bible, including God, are out of reach of our tools and experiments. Any attempt to test, observe or replicate supernatural events mentioned in the bible : either the event was observed and could be explained with purely natural reasons, or it could not be observed.

I fear that God may be beyond the reach of our scientific methodology because He does not wish to be a subject of research. In that case, it would be wise to keep God out of the science classroom, because He does not wish to be there.

I suspect, however, that science has actually always observed God and His actions on our world, because all happens in the world through His will. This would mean that any scientific observations, laws and theories are merely boring and secular <em>descriptions</em> of the Lord's actions. But then, what happens when the Words of God and the Actions of God appear to be contradictory ?

It is because our <em>human</em> interpretation of His Words and our <em>human</em> observations of His Actions do not match. Either the man reading the Bible made a mistake, or the man studying the world made a mistake. And both have happened in the past. We should act in this matter as we act in all other cases of contradiction : ask both men to explain their work, so that we may check it for them.

It is sinful to presume that your interpretation of God's Words is true, for you are but a man. And to say « It is written in the Bible ! » is a lie, you should instead quote the Bible and meditate differing interpretations from your peers.
