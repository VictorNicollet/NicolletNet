@title Recognizing Mistakes
@draft

Being a business owner gave me the experience to recognize mistakes in the ways other companies handle their sales process. I have made those mistakes before. I am probably making others right now.

Sometimes, a business transaction is exceptional — a surprisingly long chain of distinct issues that lead to a failed sale. I write these down as checklists for later use.

My business will be on display at a conference later this week, and I needed new tee-shirts with our logo on them. The typical online price for what we need is €20.

Close to where I live, there is a small tee-shirt decal shop. I have used them in the past and find their quality acceptable. They have a large display sign that says «3 for €49» and another that says «bring your own» — from my experience, I could come in, ask for six tee-shirts with specific decals, and leave with them within 15 minutes. The unit price would be €16.

When I came in this morning with an USB key, a number of unexpected things happened:

First, I had a high-resolution PNG copy of the logo. I am partly to blame for this — you should always use vector graphics for print — but there were enough pixels per inch that no aliasing would appear unless you looked at my chest with a magnifying glass.

The operator opened the USB key and noted «Oh, it's a PowerPoint file» — and it was certainly recognized as such. If you work with images on a daily basis, and you use PowerPoint to open PNG files, I will start to question your abilities.

<strong>Always be careful about what you say or do that might make you sound incompetent.</strong>

I expected him to ask me for a vector file. «Can I send you a vector file by e-mail?» I asked, and I started texting my co-founder about the SVG copy of the logo on the file server. «Don't worry, I can reproduce it from this.» he answered.

No, you cannot deduce all the fonts, sizes, weights, kerning and  spacing, and still be able to deliver the tee-shirts within 15 minutes.  The fact that you called a PNG file «PowerPoint» makes me wonder whether  you could ever do it. I do not want a screwed up logo on our  tee-shirts.

<strong>Don't underestimate the amount of work your clients put into the end result you see. Unless you're selling them a way to do it faster, and you have the credibility to do so.</strong>

I insisted on using our own SVG file.

Then we came to the matter of the price. He asked for €28 each. I pointed to the large «3 for €49» sign. «Oh, that's only for our own decals.» he said. I quickly calculated that for my six tee-shirts, it amounted to a €70 fee for opening an e-mail attachment. Even lawyers do not bill that much.

<strong>Never ask for a price that is higher than the price on display. Always include any non-obvious disclaimers. Never make obscene margins too obvious. </strong>

After a few seconds he added «Since you're buying so many, I can give you €2 off» — bringing the email attachment opening fee to a more acceptable €58. I declined. That price was still 25% higher than their online competitors.

<strong>When the buyer is worried about the price, don't pick a random value and hope to hit their target. Be aware of your competitor's prices. Have a believable explanation of why your work is worth the premium.
