<blockquote>For example, it might be tempting write down on a company website <em>We strive for excellency</em>; however, if you think the opposite <em>We strive for mediocrity</em>, it becomes clear that nobody would claim the latter version. Hence, since the latter <em>is</em> obvious, the former has to be too.</blockquote>
Never start a conversation with «<em>Hello, I will not murder you</em>» no matter how sincere you are about your non-murderous thoughts. But why are «<em>We will not spam you</em>» or «<em>We will not sell your personal information</em>» actual selling points that appear on internet registration forms ?

You don't expect to be murdered, but you expect websites to sell your personal information or throw spam at your inbox. <strong>Meaning is highly dependent on expectations. </strong>Writing marketing copy is about finding out what your potential customers expect you to do, and then saying something unexpected.

But sentences like «<em>We strive for excellency</em>» are not useless because their opposite is unacceptable. They are useless because anyone could say them without lying. Everyone strives for excellency as long as it does not interfere with other, higher priorities, and everyone has higher priorities than excellency, such as eating or breathing.

Why are your attempts at excellency different from those of others ?

What did you sacrifice ? «<em>We value excellency over mass production</em>» is a meaningful sentence, because it explains where you stand: low availability, high quality.

What steps are you taking ? «<em>To achieve excellency, we hire only ex-Google developers and ex-Apple designers</em>» is a meaningful sentence, however fallacious it may be.

Are your efforts recognized or endorsed ? A one-sentence recommendation from a recognized source is worth a hundred statements from you.

But do not underestimate the power of the obvious. Many of our potential customers think that we're building public nonprofit websites (we're building internal communication tools). So, right now, we are building public website functionality into our product, just so our marketing copy can say «<em>...and we also do websites!</em>» and have our readers ask «<em>what do you mean, <strong>also</strong>?</em>»
