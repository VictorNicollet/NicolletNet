Everyone is trying to tackle the problem of private group communication. Like, Google, Glassboard, Groupme, Life360, and I’ll even add Path to this list.

How necessary are they? Is email’s interface so broken that we need new ones, that make it ‘easier’ to manage how we share messages and content with different groups in our life?</blockquote>
The author is right. Communication is about moving information around, and e-mail lets you do that. If you have to communicate, and you can use e-mail, then you don't <em>need</em> anything else. I could argue that couriers racing horses across the country are also enough to communicate, but let's leave that straw man alone for a minute.

My start-up, <a href="http://runorg.com" target="_blank">RunOrg</a>, could fit right into that list of private group communication software — it is literally about the private communication of nonprofits. And RunOrg is obviously <em>unnecessary</em>: nonprofits have been around longer than we have, and their members still managed to communicate with each other using only a web site and a mailing-list.

<strong>Why am I building an unnecessary product ? </strong>Cost. RunOrg is like a mailing-list, but cheaper.

« Wait a minute ! » you say, slightly worried about my sanity, « There are free, quality e-mail or mailing list services ! How can you be cheaper than that ? »

Nonprofits are not concerned with the <i>financial cost</i> of their free tools, but they must pay close attention to the <em>time</em> and <em>willingness to participate</em> of their members. Once members start running out of either, it's bad news for the entire community. To make things worse, the natural communication pattern in most nonprofits is a hub-and-spokes model where a handful of members invest significant time and effort to keep the wheels spinning. This leads to the major two-pronged problem that RunOrg is solving :
<ul>
	<li>High-motivation <em>hub</em> members need to spend too much time and effort on internal communication.</li>
	<li>Low-motivation <em>spoke</em> members avoid any activities with a high communication cost.</li>
</ul>
If you decrease communication costs, <em>spoke</em> member participation increases and <em>hub</em> member burn-out decreases. In a way, the rest of this article could be titled <strong>Why E-Mail Sucks</strong>.
<ol>
	<li><p><strong>There is no member directory</strong>. It is surprisingly hard for a member to find out who the other subscribers to a mailing-list are, to send a private message to one of them without knowing their e-mail, or to put a face on <code>prettycakes42@gmail.com</code>.</p>

<p>In fact, <strong>member management</strong> is altogether deficient : a mailing-list administration board is no place to manage nonprofit members, and so the mailing-list subscribers are often out-of-sync with the actual member list stored somewhere in a spreadsheet.</p></li>
<li><p><b>Selective subscription is impossible</b>. Members must choose between receiving every single message or receiving none at all. Even something as simple as &laquo;I don't care about this conversation anymore.&raquo; is nearly impossible to achieve.</p><p>Selective communication is possible by creating a new mailing-list for a specific topic, but that is an administrator-level power. Also, the abstract nature of mailing-list recipients means that members are unsure of whether the relevant people will receive their message, and sometimes resort to communicating on the main mailing-list instead.</p>
</li><li><p><b>Collecting information is a pain</b>. You will receive one e-mail answer for each recipient, each with a different format, and it is your job to aggregate that information into an useful shape and update it whenever someone changes their mind.</p><p>Third party tools such as Doodle can help alleviate the pain, but the essential &laquo;Send a reminder to those who did not answer&raquo; remains out of reach.</p></li><li><p><b>Archives are a mess</b>. There's no place in a mailing-list archive where one can hope to see the up-to-date information about a topic &mdash; members instead have to trace through conversations to piece relevant information back together.</p><p>E-mail archives are perfectly horizontal : an e-mail announcing a major change in subscription fees will be sitting right next to Bob announcing that &laquo;I will be 15 minutes late.&raquo; This is absolute insanity. All that information is almost certainly wasted, because new members will rather ask questions than search the archives.</p></li><li><p><b>E-mail relies on everyone respecting conventions</b>. It only takes one person hitting Reply instead of Reply-All, or Compose instead of Reply, to break the conversation flow. The larger a group gets, the higher the probability that some people will not be willing (or able) to put in the additional effort, which in turn requires more effort from everyone else.</p></li>

Using e-mail is fine for throw-away conversations between ten or fewer people, but that communication model takes too much effort to scale beyond that. 

By addressing the five issues above, we helped nonprofits achieve feats of communication that would have taken too much time and effort to achieve using only e-mail and mailing lists.
