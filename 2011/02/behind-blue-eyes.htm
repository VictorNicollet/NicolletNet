Oh, my. Look at the time. It is almost 1:00 am here. I should already be sleeping by now.

<em>She</em> is already asleep. Which is quite surprising given that <em>she</em> needs less sleep than I do, and we usually wake up at about the same time in the morning. Of course, <em>she</em> commutes to work while I work from home, which might make it seem a bit frustrating.

<em>She</em> trusts me. And that's rational trust in my ability to cope and either succeed or cut my losses, not the watered down «Of course I trust you, honey» version.

And <em>she</em> supports me. All the way through. <em>She</em> understands that I sometimes need to work late or week-ends, that I can spend a lot of time with my associates or customers, and that I sometimes leave the house in a mess because I was too damn busy battering a feature into an appropriate shape. And <em>she</em> deals quite gracefully with my permanent obsession about my start-up.

And I certainly do not thank her for this enough. I do not think I ever could.

&nbsp;

Wait. She is not actually sleeping. The dim glow of a laptop and soft chattering of a keyboard are coming from the bedroom. She is almost as much of a geek as I am, which might be one reason she copes with my... <em>tendencies</em>.

Maybe I should get some sleep.

Yes.

Time to go.
