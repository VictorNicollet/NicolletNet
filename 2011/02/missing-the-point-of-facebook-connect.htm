@title Missing the Point of Facebook Connect
@draft

<p><strong>Facebook Connect</strong> lets Facebook users connect to third party web sites using their Facebook account, and provides the third party site with limited access to the private information of the visitor. Many sites implement it in order to increase the conversion rate from anonymous users to connected users. The main issue is how <em>greedy</em> those sites are going to be with private information access — and how <em>disproportionate</em> the access requests are in some cases.</p><p>How much access I'm willing to grant a given site obviously depends on how I intend to use it.</p><p>In this aspect, s<em>omeecards.com</em> is unusually silly. They're an online greeting card site that is surprisingly lightweight in terms of ads, and they mostly rely on you sending online greeting cards to your friends to bring them to the site. The feature they implement using Facebook Connect is posting a greeting card directly to a friend's wall, something that obviously needs me to authenticate as the owner of my Facebook account and allow them to post to my friend's wall. What <em>someecards.com</em> actually requires me to do is:</p><ul><li>Grant them access to my <em>public</em> profile information : by authenticating, they know who I am and can subsequently access my <em>public</em> profile. Because it's, you know, public.<strong></strong></li><li>Let them send me e-mail directly at my own address. <strong>Why?</strong></li><li>Let them access my birth date. <strong>Why?</strong></li><li>Let them access the birth dates of my friends. <strong>Why?</strong></li></ul><p>Out of four access requests, three of them have no relationship whatsoever to what I am actually trying to do — posting a greeting-card to the wall of a friend. This makes Facebook Connect look less like a helpful feature and more like a troll guarding a bridge. Whatever you do, do not use Facebook Connect like this!</p><p>Of course, why they are asking for this is quite obvious: they are actually having me create an account with them behind the scenes, and that information is needed to power their birthday calendar feature, which I suspect involves sending me e-mail to remind me that I should send a <em>someecards.com</em> greeting card to a friend for their upcoming birthday. And, again, they are trying to funnel users into creating an account when all they wanted was to post something to a friend's wall. These are two completely distinct use cases. Keep your act straight, please.</p><p>Naturally, what makes me say that the guys behind <em>someecards.com</em> are <em>scumbags</em> is a subtle but very interesting touch. But first, a bit of trivia about Facebook e-mailing permissions: when a third party website asks for your e-mail address, Facebook lets you choose between your actual address and a proxy address (mail sent to the proxy is forwarded by Facebook to your actual address). The entire point of using a proxy address is that, as soon as you revoke e-mail rights to that web site, the proxy address disappears and they can't send you any more mail. If you do provide your actual address, then it remains in their database for as long as they wish to keep it there, regardless of what rights you revoke or how much you complain. As a matter of principle, I always pick the proxy address. Most websites just deal with it.</p><p><strong>The <em>someecards.com </em>developers actually added a piece of code that detects if you have picked a proxy address and refuses to create your account.</strong></p><p>It is quite subtle and requires some knowledge about how proxy addresses work, and the error message tries to pass it off as a «security requirement» so I suspect few people understand exactly what is going on when this happens.</p><p>What they just said was: «<strong>We're going to send you e-mail even if you don't want to receive it anymore, and we don't want you to be able to stop us!</strong>»</p><p>Way to go, guys. Way to go.</p>
