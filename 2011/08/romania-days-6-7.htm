First, the eye candy. This is how day seven ended:

On day 6, we started from Drobeta Turnu Severin and rented a car up to Baile Herculane, nested in a valley in the mountains. There, we had a late lunch at the Hotel Ferdinand restaurant, which is beautifully laid out as a series of terraces on a fairly steep slope.

The hot mountain springs at Baile Herculane were already known by romans (hence the name), and are still active. We tried them out.

Then, we visited the nearby <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Gate_%28Danube%29" target="_blank">Iron Gates</a>, a beautiful gorge on the Danube river that separates Romania from Serbia. While driving along the Danube, I actually received a welcome SMS from the Serbian branch of my mobile provider...

Sadly, the Drobeta Turnu Severin museum was closed, which included the last standing parts of Emperor Traian's bridge (the one Romans used to bring over enough troops to seize control over Dacia).

Day seven started in Tîrgu Jiu, northeast of Drobeta Turnu Severin. We are staying at the Hotel Restaurant Europa, which happens to have a great restaurant with a great lemonade.

We drove west from the city to explore Constantin Brâncu?'s home town of Hobi?a.

We pushed further west to Baia de Aram?, visiting the Tismana monastery along the way, where we were caught by rain in a forested valley.

Back in Târgu Jiu, we visited the scluptural ensemble by Constantin Brâncu? dedicated to the solders who died in the Great War. It is composed of the <a href="http://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masa_t%C4%83cerii" target="_blank">Table of Silence</a> (twelve stone chairs around a large round stone table) followed closely by the <a href="http://ro.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poarta_S%C4%83rutului" target="_blank">Gate of the Kiss</a> (a large stone gate), then the Path of Heroes (an empty path, about 1300 m long) and finally the Column of the Infinite.

The artist designed the Path of Heroes so that a visitor sitting at the Table of Silence and looking through the Gate of the Kiss would see the Column of the Infinite in the distance. This was planned in 1935-1938. However, in 1937, king Carol II authorized the building of an orthodox church in the middle of the Path of Heroes, completely breaking the perspective.

The picture at the top of the article is one of the Column of the Infinite.
