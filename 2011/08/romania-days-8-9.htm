On day 8, we drove from Târgu Jiu to Sibiu. Alix was driving for the first half, and I caught this on the side of the road:

We stopped for what we expected to be a quick visit at the Hurez monastery near Horezu. There were many people, as August 15th is a religious celebration. While we were visiting, three ladies came up to me, handed me a camera and asked me to take a picture of them. I obliged. We met again near the cloister, where the sisters were giving out some sweets and wine, and the three of them invited us to have lunch with them in the monastery. We agreed.

Lunch was served in the two communal dining rooms of the monastery. We ate in the smaller of the two along with maybe a dozen other people, who were all quite interested in hearing about my Romanian roots and a comparison with French culture. The food was simple: vegetable <em>ciorba</em>, exceptionally tender veal with mashed potatoes, and watermelon. 

We were then invited to visit the private areas of the monastery &mdash; as one of the three women knew the mother superior quite well &mdash; and we enjoyed some coffee, sweets and some slices of delicious <em>telemea</em> cow cheese produced at the monastery, while enjoying this view:

We were also allowed to visit the bell tower:

And we were also shown the private chapel where the Brâncoveanu family used to pray, when they lived in the monastery, as well as one of the first printed bibles written in Romanian.

We took our leave two hours and a half later than we had expected to, but with a better lunch that we could have hoped to find in <em>Râmnicu Vîlcea</em>. Still, this day brought us more than just free food: knowing that people are willingly and selflessly sharing with others, expecting nothing more than a few words in return; and that the best experience is not one you can buy.

The rest of the day was spent driving up the valley of the Olt river and reaching Sibiu.

We are spending two nights at the <em>Cocosul Rosu</em> bed <strike>and breakfast</strike> (I kid you not, this means the <em>Red <strike>Cock</strike> Rooster</em>) before going to <em>Brasov</em>.

Sibiu is a Romanian city with a strong german-speaking community, beautiful medieval architecture and a much better shape than other cities we have visited so far. If I had to pick, I'd rather have Sibiu than Bucharest.

On day nine, we visited the city. The Brukenthal museum of arts was closed, but should be open again tomorrow. Instead, we visited the Brukenthal museum of history (which had a quite enjoyable exhibition about the city guilds), then toured the city under a blistering heat and unforgiving sun.
