As you might remember, we spent two nights at the <em>Cocosul Rosu</em> in Sibiu. On the whole, the stay was pretty pleasant, although the lack of a host-provided breakfast had us walk all the way to the town squares in search of a restaurant that would be open early enough to accomodate us (our final choice is Timi's, in the southwest corner of the <em>Piata Mare</em>). Also, do not under any circumstances open the window past nightfall, or you will let in an entire menagerie of bloodsucking insects.

On day 10, we started with a quick visit to the Brukenthal museum of art. The exhibits were correct bordering on remarkable, but the maze-like layout of the museum (as with, it seems, all museums we've visited in Romania so far) is extremely frustrating. Indeed, navigating involves a fair bit of backtracking, and there are often several forks both within exhibitions and between exhibitions where you will require the assistance of a museum employee, because there are no useful signs or written hints available.

Our next stop was Bra?ov. As an interesting bit of trivia, the old name of the city was Corona, and so the modern beer brand Corona lavishly sponsors the city pubs, bars and restaurant terraces.

Near the city is the pass of Bran, overlooked by the castle of Bran, the kind of castle Bram Stoker would have chosen for count Dracula to live in. The castle was renovated, its walls were painted white, and flowers were planted everywhere, so whatever eerie gothic aspect Stoker could have seen there is probably gone, but the peddlers of vampire-themed trinkets right outside the castle doors are there to stay.

Bran castle is by all definitions a tourist trap. The roads that lead to the city are lined for miles with housing and restaurant advertising, and the city itself is drowned in far more traffic than its single road can allow. Everything here reaches prices beyond anything else in the country. The ice cream parlour in front of the castle serves ice cream that would be costly in a posh Parisian restaurant, though I have no reason to assume that it is actually worth it.

I am lucky to be two meters tall and be able to see above the heads of the hundreds of tourists navigating the (again, maze-like and frustrating) corridors of the castle, although the low ceiling in many of the rooms could prove quite unforgiving if you ever forget it's there.

On day 11, we visited Bra?ov itself. Before I post pictures, here's some information about the layout of the city: most of the interesting pieces are in a valley in the Carpathes, with the south edge of the valley holding a cable car station and the name "BRASOV" written on the top, Hollywood-style, and the north edge of the valley holding two fortified towers (the white tower and the black tower). Inside the valley is the Council Square (<em>Piata Sfatului</em>) and the Black Church.

Our first trip of the day involved the cable car. The view was so gorgeous, we forgot to take good pictures of it.

After we came back down, we visited the white and black towers.

[caption id="" align="aligncenter" width="640" caption="Black tower."]<img src="http://farm7.static.flickr.com/6181/6056886872_b55d3487c8_z.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="480" />[/caption]

Both towers contain museums. The Black tower museum was opened every day 9-6, and we arrived at around 1 pm, so the museum was obviously <em>closed</em>. I swear, all the museums we try to see are closed for unspecified or ridiculous reasons when we get there.

The White tower museum was open, and therefore much more amusing.

First, let it be known that the top floor of the White tower is the best sauna in the entire city, and that is probably unintentional. The top floor of the tower has a dark wooden floor and no ceiling (it burned down in the last city-wide fire) and so it is capped with an array of glass panels that turn it into a glasshouse of sorts. You can feel the heat wrapping from your scalp down to your toes as you climb the last flight of stairs, and five minutes later you can smell yourself roasting.

The public employee in the White tower is responsible for selling tickets, but also has a small shop of various souvenirs, trinkets, postcards, audio CDs, pamphlets and other things that she <em>will</em> try to sell at any occasion, with unerring insistence. She offered me, in no more than two minutes' time, a presentation pamphlet of the White tower in French (which was actually Spanish) for 2 lei, an unfolding image book of the tower for 7 lei, two postcards for 3 lei, an audio CD about the region for 15 lei, and a small keychain trinket for 5 lei that I did not identify.

I wish I could sell my start-up product like that.

The city is also home to the Black Church, so named because it was covered in soot after the aforementioned city-wide fire. The church contains several organs collected from surrounding churches in addition to its own beautiful 4000-pipe organ. We went to a concert in the evening, involving some quite elaborate Bach and Liszt pieces.
