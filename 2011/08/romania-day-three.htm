We cannot seem to find tea &mdash; the local "Ceai" always seems to be some kind of fruit- or leaf-based infusion without actual tea, even though it is labeled as "Thé" or "Tea". I have resorted to Pepsi for my morning caffeine.

We dined at the Monte Carlo in the Ci?migiu gardens. The food is absolutely excellent, and waiters are orders of magnitude more polite than the ones we have in Paris.

Surprisingly, the crippling heat of the last few weeks turned to freezing downpour tonight, but we managed to stay inside most of the time. In front of the National History Museum, a team of workers that were restoring the pavement did not work yesterday because of the heat, and did not work this afternoon because of the rain. I wonder whether the pavement will be done by the time we leave.
