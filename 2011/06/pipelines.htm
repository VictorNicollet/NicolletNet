You're a company. Your customers give you money in return for something. They usually start out without any knowledge of your existence and end up giving you money, and the paths they follow are one of the many customer acquisition pipelines you have created (perhaps unintentionally) for your company.

They are called pipelines because they usually convey a continuous flow of customers from point A (never heard of you) to point B (gave you money). Each is comprised of segments:
<ol>
	<li><strong>They just heard about you</strong>: maybe you sent them an e-mail, called them on their phone or contacted them through a friend. Or maybe they did a Google search for your product and you were on the results page. Or they saw an ad for your product somewhere. Or your product was recommended by someone they trust. Whatever the reason, they are now aware of your existence. Some of these people will move on to the next step, which is to...</li>
	<li><strong>Learn more about you</strong>: most of the time, they will visit your web site and sometimes look for references online or in their social circles. Sometimes, they call you, or have you call them, or even ask for a meeting and quick presentation. Either way, some of these contacts will decide that your company or product is interesting enough to...</li>
	<li><strong>Try out your product</strong>: this could be a free limited-time trial, a demo version, an on-site pilot, a trailer video, a sample tray in a shop, or any other form of discovery that lets them actually experience your product without any serious commitment on their part. You can get away without a demo version if your product is either cheap enough that buying it once does not count as a significant commitment (such as buying a candy) or popular enough that it can convince customers on reputation alone (such as Half-Life 3). Anyway, based on the trial or the reputation, they will decide whether they...</li>
	<li><strong>Become customers</strong>: this is the interesting part, where you get money in return for whatever you provide.</li>
</ol>
The number of people at each stage in the pipeline decreases: not all people who hear about you will even visit your website, not all people who visit your website will download the demo, and not all people who download the demo will buy the full version. Since having more people at the bottom of the pipeline is a good idea, a lot of efforts will go into making the pipeline more efficient — losing less people along the way. The <strong>customer conversion rate</strong> represents the percentage of customers that go from point A to point B, and you usually want the CR to be as high as possible.

In practice, there are two other important things to keep in mind : the <strong>customer acquisition cost</strong> is how much money you spend on a given customer (on average) to get them through the pipeline. If your pipeline costs you $200,000 in advertisement, phone bills, salesman wages and bonuses, to turn 1,000,000 people into 1,000 customers, then your CAC for that pipeline is $200/customer. The <strong>customer lifetime value</strong> is how much you can expect to earn from that customer over time, after subtracting the cost of the products you sold. If a customer pays $5 for a book that cost you $2 to manufacture, and never comes back, their CLV is $3.

What matters, then, is not the customer conversion rate, but your net profit per customer : CLV - CAC. A pipeline with a CAC of $200 that leads to a book-buying CLV of $3 is a pipeline that wastes $197 per customer in marketing-and sales-related costs: you spent $200,000 to have 1,000 customers buy $5000 worth of books (of which you only get to keep $3000) for a net loss of $197,000 ! In short, your job is making sure that the CLV - CAC difference is as high as possible in all your pipelines.

The reason why increasing the CR is a good idea is that a higher rate means more people come out of the pipeline, so the total pipeline cost is divided among all of them, and thus the CAC decreases. If I were to double the conversion rate on the above $200,000 pipeline, I would get 2,000 customers and the CAC would decrease to $100. Usually, a higher CR means lower CAC, but this breaks down when increasing the CR costs money: if you paid an additional $300,000 to get the better advertisements and salesmen that allow you to jump to 2,000 customers, then the CAC would actually increase to $250 ! Similarly, lowering the price usually means more people will become customers, which increases the CR and decreases the CAC — but it will also have an impact on the CLV, since you are now earning less money on every customer. If the price drops by $10 and the cost drops by $7, you just lost $3. Per customer.
<h3>Optimizing Pipelines Is Hard</h3>
The entire issue of sales and marketing can be summed up in a single short sentence:

<strong>You have to tweak the customer pipeline, which costs money, and you have no idea whether the conversion rate will improve enough to pay for the changes.</strong>

Usually, people have reasons to leave the pipeline other than the price. By finding those reasons and addressing the underlying issues, you increase the conversion rate. So, your course of action is:
<ol>
	<li>Find out why people are leaving the pipelines.</li>
	<li>Find out how you could eliminate or mitigate that issue.</li>
	<li>Estimate how much it would cost, how the conversion rate would evolve, and the resulting acquisition cost.</li>
	<li>Pick the solution that improves the acquisition cost the most, and implement it.</li>
	<li>Go to step 1.</li>
</ol>
Steps 1 and 3 are the difficult ones.

Step 1 is difficult because you need to determine why <strong>people who are not your customers</strong> don't buy your product. Do you have an on-site satisfaction poll ? Do you send them a quick e-mail ? Do you have their contact information at all ? <em>Do you even know what your conversion rate is</em> ?

Step 3 is difficult because you actually need to estimate how many people would buy based on that one change. This is even harder, because people can always find new reasons not to buy, so that number will probably be smaller than your estimates from step 1.

These steps usually turn into the easier sequence known as <strong>A/B testing</strong>:
<ol>
	<li>Guess, or pay an expert to guess, why the people might be leaving the pipelines.</li>
	<li>Implement a solution that addresses the issue.</li>
	<li>Compare the new (B) and the old (A) conversion rates.</li>
	<li>If the solution actually improved profits, keep it !</li>
	<li>Go to step 1.</li>
</ol>
This solution does work, but it has two pretty heavy limitations. The first is that the solution from step 2 needs to be fairly cheap — it would be insane to implement a new major feature only to discover that no one cares about paperclip-shaped assistants. So, <strong>if the actual reason people are not buying is that a critical feature is missing, you will not find out through A/B testing</strong>.

The second limitation is that A/B testing has high fixed costs, because you need to actually change page layouts and shopping cart workflows for every test. These costs are one-shot, so they will be spread over all the customers coming out of the new pipeline — spending $1000 to get from 10,000 customers to 15,000 customers is a bargain, spending that same $1000 to get from 10 to 15 is not. So, unless your existing pipeline already has a fairly good throughput, A/B testing solutions to significant issues might just be too costly.
