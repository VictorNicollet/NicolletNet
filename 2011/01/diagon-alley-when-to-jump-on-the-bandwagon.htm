@title Diagon Alley - When to Jump on the Bandwagon?
@draft

In J. K. Rowling's <em>Harry Potter</em> series, Diagon Alley is a fictional place in London filled to the brim with magic-related shops and institutions, hidden away from the eyes of non-magical humans. It makes sense, if you're a wizard wishing to establish a new shop and seeking as large an audience as possible, to do so in Diagon Alley: not only would you benefit from the existing infrastructure that keeps Muggles away and allows easy access to wizards, but you would also have improved access to the customers of existing shops that happen to be in the area. More wizards walk through the alley in minutes than would walk through any other street in London over the course of an entire week.

In Paris, I enjoy the services of our very own Diagon Alley. It is actually called <strong><a href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;source=s_q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=Rue+Monsieur+le+Prince,+Paris,+France&amp;sll=48.850438,2.339895&amp;sspn=0.001497,0.003455&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=Rue+Monsieur+le+Prince,+75006+Paris,+France&amp;t=h&amp;z=16">Rue Monsieur-Le-Prince</a></strong>, and it can be found stretching from the Luxembourg gardens near the Senate and north up to the Place de l'Odéon. Instead of magical shops, it is home to a massive number of Japanese sushi restaurants: Itadaki, Tokiotori, Kiotori, Yokorama, Top Sushi, Sushi Yaki and Sushi Royal <em>among others</em>. The number of such restaurants is surprising: this is a short, narrow one-way street, much smaller than the nearby Boulevard Saint-Michel and Boulevard Saint-Germain, which means that you literally cannot walk ten feet without seeing a sushi restaurant. The local market for sushi food is beyond saturated, and the competition between restaurants is fierce — a quick strategic analysis would determine that a new restaurant would enjoy far less competition if they were to establish themselves anywhere else.

This is not caused by a heavy immigrant population. In fact, the area is known for its high real estate rates and is out of reach of the average immigrant budget.

Nor is this a unique situation: <strong>Rue Saint-Anne</strong> is a sister street on the other side of the Seine where most of the Donburi and Okonomiyaki traditional Japanese restaurants can be found. All together, clustered on a single street.

This makes no sense. Why is this happening?

Back in 1991, Paul Krugman penned <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/~pkrugman/geography.pdf" target="_blank">Increasing Returns and Economic Geography</a>: as transportation costs decrease and economies of scale increase, Krugman argues, it becomes more efficient for a given industry to concentrate in a single location, because the transportation costs involved in having to move the products are paid for by the economies of scale involved. For instance, building cell phones in a single city and selling them in an entire country is cheaper than having a cell phone factory in every city.

Sushi restaurants have minor economies of scale as far as production goes: fresh fish is a bit cheaper when the delivery does not involve a one-hour detour (especially since small daily deliveries are involved to keep the fish fresh), and it's easier to set up a new sushi restaurant in a building previously housed another that went bankrupt, because the fridges and tools and kitchen are already there. But does this explain everything?

Actually, there are economies of scale in <em>marketing</em> here: being an exotic food, a local market alone is not enough to support a sushi restaurant because most people don't eat there daily. To survive, a restaurant must have a brand strong enough to cover a wider area. Few sushi restaurants have the power to create their own brand, but a dozen of them on a single short street is enough to make Rue Monsieur-Le-Prince the <em>de facto</em> location where sushi and yakitori can be eaten. This, in turn, creates an incentive for more sushi restaurants to appear there: customers are loyal to the <em>street</em>, not the individual restaurants, and a cleaner (by virtue of being newer) restaurant might attract more customers.

Of course, there's still niche sub-markets within the street:
<ul>
	<li>There's at least one restaurant open for lunch or dinner, including holidays and week-ends.</li>
	<li>There's at least one restaurant open on afternoons.</li>
	<li>The restaurant closest to the large Luxembourg underground station also happens to be the largest, in order to have as many customers as possible with average food quality.</li>
	<li>There are two restaurants with quiet, clean private rooms for business customers.</li>
	<li>There's at least one restaurant with a nice second-floor view on the Boulevard Saint-Michel.</li>
	<li>There's at least one tightly packed chinese-friendly restaurant.</li>
</ul>
In conclusion, while there are advantages to finding your own market and having a monopoly there, there are also advantages to sticking close to existing competitors in the form of economies of scale in production and marketing: if you use mainstream tools, you will find more support for them ; if you provide a well-known kind of service, you will have an easier time convincing your customers that they need it.
