... at least once in 2010 according to the MFPI <sup>[<a href="#mfpi">1</a>]</sup>, finally answering accusations of bias due to the choice of the population sample. The MFPI contacted a representative sample of 988 people between March and April 2010 and asked them if they had been polled at least once during the year. 97% answered that they had been, while 3% declined to answer.

Silly, right?

Sample-based polling involves asking a small but diverse sample of people a series of questions, and then using national census data (and similar nation-wide sources) to extrapolate those results to the entire population. So, if a report somewhere says that out of 65 million people, 50,000 people are roman catholic caucasian males with a higher education between the ages of 25 and 35 and living in the Paris area, and you have in your sample one roman catholic caucasian male with a higher education between the ages of 25 and 35 living in the Paris area, then you will extrapolate the answer of that person to the 50,000 others who are construed to be identical.

The nice thing about sample-based polling, when done correctly, is that <em>on average</em>, it works: run the same poll one hundred million times with a different sample every single time, and you will probably end up with the correct result.

However, it's easy to get things wrong, because sometimes the opinion of 50,000 people hinges on whether the one person from that group is a lunatic. Just a few examples:
<ul>
	<li>Your questions might introduce unnecessary variance. I used to be a frequent user of the underground lines 13 and 14. When I was polled about this, they asked what lines were involved in my <em>current trip</em> — which happened to be a short detour to a restaurant to meet a friend there — and ended up attributing my extrapolated package of 5,000 users to line 7 instead.</li>
	<li>People might not answer honestly. If you're perceived as a tyrant, ask any independent statistics institute from the western world to poll your population — how do you think the terrified population of urban centers will react to a phone call asking whether they love their president for life? <a href="http://allafrica.com/stories/201007150213.html" target="_blank">90% approval rating, yay</a>!</li>
</ul>
To end on a positive note, according to another MFPI poll, 100% of my girlfriends agree that I had a great impact on their lives.
