Here is a hypothetical situation :
<blockquote>The kingdom is in trouble, and the King must enact a new law. Of course, such a law will make many people happy <em>for years</em>, but some people will be annoyed by it <em>for a few days</em>. He has two possible choices :

Law A will make <strong>20%</strong> of the people happy at the cost of annoying <strong>1%</strong>.

Law B will make <strong>90%</strong> of the people happy at the cost of annoying <strong>10%</strong>.

Which law should the monarch enact ?</blockquote>
This is not the kind of problem that engineer types like me enjoy — no matter how much we try to abstract away the details and build a sound foundation for that decision, some <em>ethics</em> will inevitably seep in.  Is it right to annoy an additional 9% of the people so that 70% more people become happier? Where do we draw the line in term of percentage, and in terms of annoyance — a few days might be fine, but what about a few months or years?

As you might expect, this is not an entirely hypothetical exercise. It is, in fact, the very core of the opt-in versus opt-out debate. Above, law A is <strong>opt-in</strong> : only 21% of the population knows about its effects, but at least there will be very few complaints ; law B is <strong>opt-out</strong> : it ensures that 100% of the population knows about it, but it will annoy the 20% who will have to manually opt out.

My start-up hosts discussion forums for associations. Every one of our customers has faced the same decision : should they send an e-mail to their association members telling them « please come and sign up on our forums » or should they import their member directory and let naysayers unsubscribe ?

With the opt-in approach — please come and sign up — the initial e-mail is followed by a small number of sign ups, usually from the more active or dedicated members, and will be ignored by everyone else. If the number of initial adopters does not reach a critical mass, the forums will simply die off and be forgotten by everyone.

With the opt-out approach — import all the members — everyone will be notified every time a new message is posted, as would happen on a mailing-list. A forum message from a friend is a lot more interesting than a « please come and sign up » e-mail and drives more members to connect and participate. The critical mass is reached far easier (and faster!) and the forum becomes an essential part of the community. However, those who did not wish to participate will receive e-mail that is <em>literally</em> unsolicited, and they will complain about it — while the number of active users increases significantly, the number of complaints and unsubscription requests increases even faster. The delicious irony of it all is that the number of complaints is driven up <em>because</em> the communication tool helps those annoyed members find each other and speak up in unison.

<strong>Before continuing, let me fend off two possible problems.</strong>

First, the opt-out approach is <em>not</em> intended to be a sneaky trick — we always strongly advise customers to send a preliminary e-mail to all their members in advance, telling them about the plan to move to a new discussion system. Not only does it keep things civil and honest, but people who absolutely hate receiving messages from their community can ask to opt out before it is too late. Online communities have trouble blooming when 10% of the messages are complaints about the very existence of the community, so it is in everyone's interests to keep naysayers out.

And if anything else fails, we can wipe out members from our system on demand.

The second problem will be familiar to readers of Seth Godin — <strong>permission</strong>. Through the eyes of a permission marketer, to import all  the members without their prior explicit opt-in consent is absolute heresy.

I find this view a bit too extreme. Well, it does make sense when trying to sell things that 99.99% of the people will not care about, such as viagra or cheap hotels in Bangkok. But members actually <em>care</em> about what is going on in their association, and — based on our experience — only a minority of members ever asks to be completely removed from the forums. Most members only unsubscribe from individual discussions that they do not care about, and choose to remain available on the forums as a whole.

It feels sad that so many people would miss out on a great experience just so a handful of curmudgeons can spare the effort of clicking an unsubscribe link.

<strong>Back to the point</strong>.

As far as I can tell, the approach that helps most members get involved in an online community is :
<ol>
	<li>In advance, send them an e-mail telling them that the association is about to move to another online community system — in our situation, it could be described as a mix between a forum (for those who wish to be very active) and a mailing-list (for the occasional participants) — and that each of them will receive those communications <strong>on an opt-out basis</strong>.</li>
	<li>You will receive messages saying « this is a bad idea » or « I don't want to receive those communications » and you should take steps to make sure that no person who opted out at this stage is <em>ever</em> imported into the forums. Unless they ask for it later, anyway.</li>
	<li>After enough time has passed — at least 48 hours for large associations — import everyone into the forums, and write a welcome message there explicitly asking them to say hello when they reach it for the first time.</li>
	<li>If any other people request to be completely unsubscribed, you may simply remove them from your forums and they will stop receiving messages. If you need to absolutely make sure that all their data has been wiped from our database, drop us a line and we'll take care of it for you.</li>
</ol>
We have had several customers build a thriving online community for their association with this approach, and have even seen a few « get me out of here » naysayers change their minds and come back online, once they understood everyone else was using it.

Where do <em>you</em> stand on the matter ?
