Working on a start-up involves many decisions — how features should work, how pages should look like, how advertising should be written... and making decisions is a difficult process when working as a team. Even in the tightest-knit team of two, disagreements happen.

Sometimes, on the less important decisions, you might get out of it by default — A disagrees with B, but doesn't care enough about the topic to actually do something about it, so B proceeds anyway.

Sometimes, decisions will be dictated by competence. If A disagrees with a proposed solution because of objective technical or legal implications, well, that's it.

Quite often, though, there is no such solution. This is where one must be aware of the dangerous tendency of <em>consensus</em>-based teams to devolve into <em>compromise</em>-based discussions.

<strong>Consensus</strong>-based discussions feel like this :
<blockquote>A: I'm going to frobnicate the thingamajig.
B: If you frobnicate the foobar instead, you would get a 10% increase in floogum output.
A: You're right. Let's frobnicate the foobar, then.</blockquote>
That is, initially differing opinions evolve through an <strong>argumentation</strong> process, so that everyone agrees that the final outcome is the best one.

<strong>Compromise</strong>-based discussions feel like this :
<blockquote>A: I'm going to frobnicate the thingamajig.
B: I would rather that we frobnicate the bazquux instead. Might get better results.
A: Actually, I have a hunch that the thingamajig is the better option.
B: Tell you what, let's frobnicate 50% of the thingamajig and 50% of the bazquux. This way we have everything covered.
A: All right.</blockquote>
Here, initially differing opinions are settled through a <strong>negotiation</strong> process, so that everyone's input is respected, but no one agrees the final outcome is really the best.

Compromise is a bad idea for several reasons.
<ul>
	<li>Quite often, going 100% with any reasonable solution is better than investing only 50% into two different solutions. In more general terms, lack of commitment to a single strategy or objective is a dangerous thing to do, and often less effective than commiting to any strategy or objective one might come up with.</li>
	<li>Compromise is not agreement, it's negotiation : you give something and get something else in return until everyone agrees that it's an even trade. People who are good negotiators tend to dictate their terms in such circumstances, and others might feel helpless and useless after a few unbalanced trades. It also leads to « I agreed with your idea yesterday so agree with mine today » or « You've already changed my idea enough, stop asking me to change it again, » both of which are content-free sentences that aim to make a decision based on interpersonal history instead of objective analysis.</li>
	<li>The inability to come to a logical conclusion sometimes happens because there is not enough data available to decide. The first priority in such circumstances should be to actually search for the data (possibly accepting one of the proposed solutions as temporary until the data is collected), not settling for an arbitrary compromise.</li>
	<li>Building consensus is hard when people have trouble putting their insight into words, no matter how convincing or true that insight might be. I'm objectively right, but I cannot seem to explain to you the reason for it. This can mean going for a compromise today instead of a consensus tomorrow — hasty decisions are seldom good. Always make sure everyone has had enough time to think the decision through, even if it means adjourning it until later.</li>
</ul>
