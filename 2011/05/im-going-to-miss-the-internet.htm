My first dealings with the internet went through a 56k modem. I had to find and save pages to the computer to browse them offline in order to avoid the large phone bills that came after you stayed online for too long. These days, I have five computers plugged into a single fat pipe at all times, with more bandwidth than I could ever use, at one hundredth of the former cost. But still, as the internet and the computing world improved and matured, some key aspects were lost.

Browsing the internet used to be an anonymous activity. As you came online, you were awarded an IP address, which acted as your avatar in your dealings with other computers on the network. There was no way for anyone on the internet to reliably trace any kind of online activity back to your real-life existence, because there was no link between IP addresses and human beings. Even if someone did find out that you owned a given IP address, you could still argue that it had belonged to someone else when the activity took place. Sure, a handful of countries that were known for their human rights track record could play Big Brother with their citizens, but I lived in a first world country that would certainly respect my right to privacy. I was wrong. Browsing the internet in France is no longer anonymous, as internet service providers are required by law to log the owners of every single IP address they allocated. There is now a link between your IP address and your name and home address, and government agencies may follow that link to hunt you down.

I used to believe that the Internet was immune to such tampering because it was decentralized, that the RIAA and MPAA were fighting a losing uphill battle, that any attempt to restrict online freedom would be voided by technical counter-measures and workarounds. This belief was epitomized by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gilmore_%28activist%29">John Gilmore</a> in his 1993 quote: 
<blockquote>The Net interprets censorship as damage and routes around it</blockquote>
This warm feeling of eternal resilience relied on a single assumption : almost every single data transfer technology can be abused to transfer illegal data (the latest Lady Gaga single, child pornography, mentions of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiananmen_Square">Tian'anmen Square</a>), and the government cannot afford to outlaw all data transfer technologies. I call this the <strong>Collateral Damage Assumption</strong> &mdash; any effective solution would involve too much collateral damage to be implemented by lawmakers. But this assumption, as self-evident as it may seem in a first world country, is incorrect.

<h3>Subtle side-effects</h3>

One reason why this assumption breaks down is that lawmakers only care about flashy, obvious side-effects. They honestly believe they can get away with subtle side-effects, so they will settle on solutions that hide away the collateral damage so that taxpayers will not notice it until it is too late. I have an actual example here, so bear with me. 

<div style="margin:auto;width:321px;background-color:#EEE;padding:10px"><img src="http://www.hadopi.fr/sites/all/themes/hadopi/images/visuels/logo_site_hadopi.png"/></div>

A few years back, copyright owners spied on peer-to-peer networks to identify the IP addresses of illegal downloaders, traced those back to the actual names and home addresses of real-life people, sued them for infringement, and failed because there was no proof that those people were actually guilty of downloading copyrighted works, as opposed to merely being the unlucky owners of a hijacked WiFi network &mdash; it takes <a href="http://www.livescience.com/9290-home-wi-fi-hacked-minutes.html">a few minutes and a few dollars</a> to hack into a secured WiFi network, not to mention all those open WiFi hotspots in various restaurants and institutions. 

Then, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HADOPI_law">the law that became known as HADOPI</a> was introduced. Among other things, the bill made it a misdemeanor to connect to the Internet a device that is insufficiently protected against malicious users. If a copyrighted work was downloaded from your IP address without your consent, then you failed to protect your internet connection against that malicious user and you would be sentenced for the misdemeanor. Can you swear that your home network is secure? Do you regularly change the WiFi key, keep your router firmware and operating systems up to date, and monitor your traffic for any suspicious activity? Me neither, and I suspect the average Internet connection owner does not even understand what changing a WiFi key involves.

The media and several activist groups made a fuss about the fact that the sentence carries the possibility of <em>being barred from owning an internet connection for an entire year</em>. That's annoying and extreme, but certainly not the main issue.

Few recognized this law for what it was: reducing the number of false negatives (letting pirates off the hook) at the cost of having more false positives (punishing helpless, innocent people). But those false positives are a subtle side-effect: the only people who notice are those directly affected by it, and those with the technical skills to understand that securing an internet connection is hard. Outside of well-informed technical circles, the general opinion on the HADOPI remains that <em>you will only be punished if you download copyrighted works</em>. 

And there were even subtler effects. One of them was that many pirates, aware that they were at risk of being discovered, started using encrypted file sharing protocols in order to evade detection. This significantly increased the amount of encrypted data over the network, because downloading the latest episode of The Big Bang Theory uses more bandwidth than all your HTTPS browsing and SSH terminals combined. Needless to say, <a href="http://www.zeropaid.com/news/90967/nsa-yelled-at-france-over-three-strikes-legislation/">the NSA was less than happy</a> about having a lot more data to sift through to when looking for terrorist threats.

While on the topic of subtle collateral damage, there is yet another example, this time in an otherwise fairly decree by our government. Around these parts, laws provide a general framework, and decrees are then used to fill in the details such as what forms should be filled, how much money must be paid, or what data is covered by "should keep the relevant information for at least one year". In this case, the decree <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-12983734">asked for user passwords to be kept</a> around for at least one year, going against the fundamental principle of password security which is to <strong><a href="http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/09/youre-probably-storing-passwords-incorrectly.html">never store user passwords, ever</a></strong>. I'm fairly certain that the people who added "and passwords" to that decree had absolutely no idea that this was an insanely bad idea, and I suspect that it would take quite some time to explain exactly why it's such a bad idea.

<h3>General Misunderstanding</h3>

In the end, we live in a world where only a small technical elite can hope to understand the consequences of such decisions &mdash; and that is when we do agree with each other. Decisions by the unsuspecting lawmakers, unopposed by the uninformed general population, can ultimately hurt the Internet in subtle but permanent ways.

This week, <a href="http://www.theherald.com.au/news/national/national/general/cyber-law-risks-making-the-ordinary-criminal-expert/2167579.aspx">the Queensland police likened receiving photos to taking stolen television sets</a>. This is a pretty good analogy, except for the fact that 1° you cannot make a copy of a stolen television by clicking a button and 2° you do not receive thousands of television sets (stolen or otherwise) on a daily basis while browsing the web. 

<strong>The easiest way to explain computing concepts to normal people is to use analogies, and all analogies are inherently flawed.</strong> Hilarity ensues when the analogy is taken to its logical but incorrect conclusion.

To make sane decisions, instate sane laws and pass sane judgements on the computing world, working by analogy is the last thing you want to do. Copyright infringement is not theft. Privacy invasion is not theft. The only acceptable way of dealing with the complex technical concepts around us is to determine their consequences in the real world, and decide based on those consequences.

What are the real-world consequences of a journalist receiving unauthorized Facebook pictures when writing an article about the security issues that allowed the pictures to be obtained in the first place? Are any of these consequences worth arresting the journalist and confiscating his property? 

<h3>Being Left Behind</h3>

There's another reason why the Collateral Damage Assumption is incorrect. We say to the computer manufacturers "let us install any software we want on our computers, or you will kill the economy" and thus we retain the right to install any software. Can you imagine the next version of Windows refusing to install any kind of peer-to-peer software? That would require some heavy restrictions on installing new software, so no one would buy it. 

There was no collateral damage to Apple deciding that all applications on the iPhone must be accepted by the App Store first. They defined a new market and set their own rules, and most people accepted this situation without flinching.  

We praised the Internet, and the computing world, for their versatility, for their ability to evolve around any obstacles in their path. But we assumed that this meant those features we held so dear would remain forever. This is completely wrong : the world will move away from any features that do not fit in anymore. I assumed that I would forever be able to participate anonymously on various online communities, but <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2011/03/06/techcrunch-facebook-comments/">they are starting to use Facebook Comments</a> because there is now a critical mass of people who 1° use Facebook and 2° don't care about writing things in their own name on the Internet. The "mainstream Internet" has already given up on many earlier features I took for granted : 

<ul>
	<li><strong>Browsing without cookies or javascript</strong>. Now, sites require these even if you do not have an account.</li>
	<li><strong>Interacting anonymously or with pseudonyms</strong>. Now, you need to use facebook.</li>
	<li><strong>Dealing with many small tools and communities</strong>. Now, there are a handful of huge "cloud" conglomerates and communities.</li>
	<li><strong>Content placed online by competent experts</strong>. These days, anyone can create a blog to share they're [sic] mistakes with everyone else.</li>
</ul>

As with anything that evolves, nothing is forever, not even those things that we though the Internet could never exist without. 

The Internet isn't dying. It's becoming something else that I'm not entirely happy with.
