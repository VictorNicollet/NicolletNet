The nuclear power plant <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fukushima_I_nuclear_accidents" target="_blank">Fukushima I</a> has been the center of international attention this week in the aftermath of the Sendai earthquake and tsunami. They are currently having technical issues in four distinct reactors, for a variety of reasons. Depending on whom you ask, this might result in either putting those reactors out of commission permanently, or inflicting potentially lethal radiation doses throughout in East Asia.

Nuclear science is hard, but I still kind-of-get-it because I have a reasonable background in physics. But a real-life nuclear reactor involves a huge amount of small practical details that are beyond the grasp of anyone but a trained engineer — and even then, different types of reactors involve different areas of expertise. I suspect that most experts in the specific technology used at Fukushima I are busy solving the hell out of that mess, so we will not be getting a detailed explanation from them any time soon.

Until then, our main sources of information are far less reliable. Popular french media website Rue89 ran a headline about a nuclear explosion having happened, which was later revealed to be incorrect. Contradicting sources indicate the level of irradiation of workers anywhere between 100% and 2000% of allowed the yearly dose, some state that the confinement was breached while others state that it was not, and the French and Japanese atomic agencies disagree on whether this is a 4/7 or 6/7 catastrophe. Anti-nuclear activists are quoted in the media and rant on about «huge risks» without ever mentioning what those risks are and why they are huge, while pro-nuclear activists insist that sustained damage is well within acceptable (and foreseen) limits. And the media vomits technically incorrect approximations to make things easier to understand, skipping such critical details as the half-life of radioactive gases or the impossibility for the fuel to turn into an atomic bomb.

I've had the mixed pleasure of listening to an interview during which the first explosion at the Fukushima plant happened — the journalist interrupted the interview and asked the interviewee, a nuclear power expert, whether the explosion that just happened was a very bad thing or not. I know experts are known for being above-average geniuses, but <em>please</em>! How can you expect anyone to provide a reasonable answer based on a single-sentence description of an unconfirmed explosion?

I trust that the experts out there in Japan know what they are doing, and are taking the appropriate steps to protect the population should the worst scenario happen. So, I'm going to patiently wait until the crisis is over and all those experts can work on a detailed postmortem I can read through.
