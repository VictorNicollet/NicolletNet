<div class="scary-fade">It was early february a few years ago. My girlfriend had just left France, and was to stay in China for six months, so I was getting back to my old teen programmer habits of writing code alone at my desktop computer at 4:00 am. My room was the typical no-girlfriend-around mess, with old clothes lying on the bed, dishes on the corner of the desk, unused laptops scattered around the room, soft music in my headphones and my two monitors being the only light source in the room.

I'm afraid I don't really remember in what order things did happen that night. I do remember hearing a short, sad whistle coming from behind me, feeling something soft, large and <em>warm</em> pressed against my lower back, and all the lights suddenly going out, all in quick succession.

I immediately stood up and turned around, my not-yet-wireless headphone cord dragging unidentified objects off the desk into a cacophonous cascade, my badly adjusted eyes trying to see through the darkness to understand what had just touched me, or where that noise might have come from.

So I just stood there for a while. After a few seconds, I heard a noise, different from the first one. It sounded like fingernails on plastic. I could not precisely locate where it was coming from, and it was so soft that I quickly dismissed it as either a by-product of my terrified imagination or one of the fallen objects rolling around.

Then, I heard that same noise again ten seconds later. And again every ten seconds after that. It did not sound like anything a machine could make (and besides, all appliances and computers were powered off anyway), in fact it had an almost human feel to it.

I called out "Il y a quelqu'un?" ("Is anybody there?"), then immediately felt silly at asking such a question out loud while alone at night in my apartment. My question was shortly followed by a short male laughter coming from somewhere in my room. Then the finger-on-plastic noise again. And again.

It occurred to me that having a panic attack in the dark was not very advisable, and that I could at least use one of my laptops as a light source. I found one, picked it up, placed it on the desk and opened the lid. The screen came to life showing a browser pop-up window for some online poker playroom (don't judge me!) that bathed the room in a pale green light. I started looking around for my flashlight, which would provide better illumination and let me reach the fuse box, when I heard someone distinctly laughing right behind me.

I turned around, striving to drive my elbow into what I hoped to be a sensitive part of the intruder's anatomy and ended up being a lot of otherwise uninhabited air. And I notice a video playing on the poker pop-up, of a smug man like you expect to see on a poker pop-up, juggling with some poker chips in his hand and <em>making that fingernail-on-plastic noise</em>. And <em>laughing</em> every ten animation loops. Genius.

From what I gathered the next day, the power had been cut in the middle of the night, prompting my alarm clock to whistle loudly in its death throes. The laptop had been playing that poker video since I laid it down, but the sound had been drowned out by the music in my headphones and only became audible when the music stopped and I took them off. I still have no idea what the warm sensation was.
