Last year, I created a PayPal account with no associated credit card number, as I was to receive some contest prize money to pay for a specific product. Since then, I have received a lot e-mail from PayPal.

There were several dozen advertisements that I would rather not have received. There was not a single e-mail to notify me that the credit card I once entered to do a one-shot payment six months ago had instead become associated with the account and was going to be used to pay for anything PayPal thought I should pay. There was not a single e-mail to notify me that the original specific product had a one-year renewal policy which, given that there was now a credit card associated with the account, was about to charge me again. Nor was there any e-mail to notify me that I had just been charged.

When an internet service sends flurries of advertisements but fails to send relevant and important information, it's time to leave. I realize now that I should have closed my PayPal account right away, instead of keeping it around «<em>in case I might need it again later</em>»

A lesson learned and an account closed.
