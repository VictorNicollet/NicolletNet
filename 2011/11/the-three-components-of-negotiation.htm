We negotiate several times a day, even if we do not recognize those occurences as such — « accept or walk away » is a fairly instinctive, if somewhat inefficient, negotiation strategy, and it goes hand in hand with the modern « take it or leave it » strategy employed by most mass consumer shops.

What is negotiation anyway, and why does it happen?

It happens because when humans cooperate, they get a cake that is bigger than the sum of its parts, and they need to decide how to split it. For instance, if I grow potatoes and you breed cattle, we could decide to put together my delicious Désirée tubers and your tasty Charolais steaks, which is a big improvement over otherwise potato- or beef-only diets. And then, we would argue over how much of the final mix each of us would get:
<blockquote>ME: We both contributed equally, so let's get 50% each.
YOU: Breeding cattle is harder than watching potatoes grow, so I want 65%.
ME: Suit yourself, I know a guy who only asks for 55%.
YOU: Fine, I'll go as low as 60% because I like your blog.
ME: I just told you I know a guy who...
YOU: ...and that would save you the effort of finding that guy before lunch.
ME: Right. 60% it is, then.</blockquote>
You were a good negotiator, so you managed to squeeze 10% out of this. What happened? Let's break this down.
<h4>Irrational Arguments</h4>
« We both contributed equally » might be true. Maybe I spent as much time growing my potatoes than you spent working in your ranch. But that is not my argument. What I have written between the lines is that it is <em>fair</em> for equal efforts to receive equal rewards.

And <strong>fairness</strong> is not a rational argument. It is a subtle way to circumvent rational thinking and aim for our unconscious ethical programming and, by definition, make decisions that are not in our best interest. In the eyes of a good negotiator, this is a loophole to be exploited.

There are many other such loopholes in the human mind. My favorites are:

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reciprocity_(social_psychology)" target="_blank"><strong>Reciprocity</strong></a> is an atavistic impulse to give back whenever we receive something, even if that something is mostly unrelated to our objectives. In the example above, going from 65% to 60% is cleverly framed as a gift instead of a simple acceptance of my terms, which makes me unwilling to further haggle over whether it should be 57.5%.

<strong>Imprinting</strong> is our tendency, when we have no idea how much something is worth, to go with the first guess, clue or hint that we find about it. By suggesting a 50-50 trade, I imprinted you on the idea that potatoes are about as valuable than meat, and this serves as a basis for your « reasonable » 35-65 counter-proposal instead an extreme trade like, say, 3-97.

Guess what the market rate for potatoes and Charolais steak is? 3-97. I would like to correct my previous sentence:
<blockquote>You were a <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">good</span><strong> bad </strong>negotiator, so <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">you</span><strong> I</strong> managed to squeeze <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">10%</span> <strong>37%</strong> out of this.</blockquote>
And then, there's a slew of <strong>emotional manipulation</strong> that does not appear at all in my example above. You can feign disappointment to try and get more out of a deal — "I really hoped you, of all people, could get this done for me." You can pretend to be offended, shocked or angry in order to cause a large shift in the terms being negotiated — when you haggle in a bazaar, quote a price that is too low and you will be told that it is <em>insulting</em>, and kicked out of the store.

There are many other examples. Go read <a href="http://conversionxl.com/17-lesser-known-ways-to-persuade-people/" target="_blank">this blog article</a> and read <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002C949KE" target="_blank">Predictably Irrational</a> by Dan Ariely.
<h4>Rational arguments</h4>
You might expect this section to be as rich as the previous one, but it is not. There are only two different rational arguments you can say in a negotiation: "I will  not accept this outcome because [credible reason]" and "You will accept this outcome because [credible reason]". Let's examine our conversation with this convention:
<blockquote>ME: <strong>Suggests 50-50</strong>
YOU: <strong>No, because</strong> [breeding cattle is harder than watching potatoes grow], <strong>suggests 35-65</strong>
ME: <strong>No, because</strong> [I know a guy who only asks for 55%]
YOU: <strong>Suggests 40-60</strong>
ME: <strong>No, because</strong> [I know a guy who only asks for 55%]
YOU: <strong>Yes, because</strong> [that would save you the effort of finding that guy before lunch]
ME: <strong>Accepts 40-60</strong></blockquote>
This is the reason why the most fundamental principle in negotiations is <strong>be willing to walk away</strong>. If you cannot or will not walk away, and the other guy knows this, then you can no longer say « No, because » and this cripples your ability to negotiate properly.

Typical reasons why I will not accept an outcome:
<ul>
	<li>The costs are greater than what I get out of it. Maybe I'll ask for more money, or non-financial benefits (exclusive rights, free advertising...)</li>
	<li>It's too risky for me. Maybe I'll ask for insurance, or add terms to our contract that provide me with acceptable protection.</li>
	<li>I can get a better offer elsewhere. You can either match that offer, give me something I cannot get elsewhere, or give up.</li>
</ul>
Typical reasons why you should accept an outcome:
<ul>
	<li>There are additional benefits you did not take into consideration, such as not spending the time to find a better offer elsewhere, or my goodwill in terms of future trades, or my reputation as your client/provider.</li>
	<li>If you do not accept now but change your mind later, I will not be able the same offer to you again in the future.</li>
</ul>
These reasons do not have to be <em>true</em>, they only have to <em>believable</em>. I don't know anyone who would accept a 45-55 split on potatoes and Charolais steak, but you don't know that, so I can still bluff my way through our negotiation, bringing you down from 65% (which is still a 32% win for me) to 60%. If you knew that no sane person would accept a 45-55 split, you could certainly call my bluff and even bring me back up to 10-90 or so.

How you present those arguments is a matter of style. Here are four different ways of presenting the same argument (you will not get more than $30k for an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APL_(programming_language)" target="_blank">APL</a> job) :
<ol>
	<li>No one else in town hires APL developers like yourself, so you either accept this $30k job or get out.</li>
	<li>I am certainly interested in your APL skills, but I would be losing money if I paid you more than $30k.</li>
	<li>We are looking to fill our APL development position, but I am not at liberty to offer you more than $30k.</li>
	<li>We have interviewed several candidates with your skills, and most of them are below your wage requirements.</li>
</ol>
Some aggressive types would prefer approach 1, while manipulator types would go with 2 (which is a lie), passive types would hide behind a third party authority using 3, and sneaky types would try to get an even lower salary quote by withholding the $30k figure in approach 4.
<h4>Alternative Benefits</h4>
This is a subtle but essential part of many successful negotiations. <strong>It's not only about the money</strong>. In the above example, I traded 5% for the ability to get my food in time for lunch — a concept that had not been mentioned at all before. You decided that instead of matching my requirements as I expressed them, you would offer me something that was unexpected and which, to you, cost less than 5% but still, to me, was worth at least 5%.

Going down alternate routes is an excellent way to get a stuck negotiation moving.
