With our hardware advances alone — computers can extract, store and analyze significantly greater amounts of data than a few years ago — it becomes easy for those who <em>have </em>data to actually <em>use</em> that data. And the software has improved, too.

There are many reasons to feel, if not unhappy, at least slightly uneasy about the direction our information society is taking.
<h4>Really? What could happen to me if my private information was used by people or organizations?</h4>
For one, many people value privacy <strong>on principle</strong>. I feel that it is my unalienable right to hide information from others as long as that information does not harm them, even if making that information public would not cause me any discomfort or trouble. Recently, <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/240646/spotify_adds_facebook_requirement_angering_users.html" target="_blank">Spotify started auto-publishing what users listened to directly on Facebook</a>. Even if telling your friends what music you are listening to hardly qualifies as discomfort or trouble, the fact that Spotify and Facebook took the decision to share that information is outrageous. That is my decision, even if the subject is of minor importance in the grand scheme of things.
<h4>Grow a spine. Who cares if you listen to Nickelback? Are you an angsty teenager?</h4>
It's not only about listening to Nickelback. There's also the oppressed, the minorities, those in a position of weakness who would suffer greatly if their church group knew they were gay, if their employer knew they were looking for another job, if their government knew they were printing pamphlets, if their friends knew they voted for another party...

The Electronic Frontier Foundation has written again and again about the implications of privacy invasions. <a href="https://www.eff.org/wp/locational-privacy" target="_blank">A simple cell phone that records your location information could cause a lot of trouble</a>:
<ul>
<blockquote>
	<li>Did you go to an anti-war rally on Tuesday?</li>
	<li>A small meeting to plan the rally the week before?</li>
	<li>At the house of one "Bob Jackson"?</li>
	<li>Did you walk into an abortion clinic?</li>
	<li>Did you see an AIDS counselor?</li>
	<li>Have you been checking into a motel at lunchtimes?</li>
	<li>Why was your secretary with you?</li>
	<li>Did you skip lunch to pitch a new invention to a VC? Which one?</li>
	<li>Were you the person who anonymously tipped off safety regulators about the rusty machines?</li>
	<li>Did you and your VP for sales meet with ACME Ltd on Monday?</li>
	<li>Which church do you attend? Which mosque? Which gay bars?</li>
	<li>Who is my ex-girlfriend going to dinner with?</li>
</blockquote>
</ul>
<h4>Then don't use a smartphone — don't use tracking technology if you don't want to be tracked.</h4>
Smartphones, I can do without, even though it seems these days most people cannot. But the internet? Not only does every site track what you do on that particular site, but there's a growing tendency for some companies to track you across multiple unrelated sites — Google and Facebook are only the tip of the iceberg. We are still far from a solution for people to say « do not track me » let alone actually enforcing that solution.

Credit and debt cards follow the same principles — your bank or credit card company knows where your are buying from, and what amounts you are buying. Your phone company knows who you call, when, and for how long. And government agencies keep a lot of information about many things you do.

In isolation, all of that information is not very useful, but once the owners of these files start sharing them, they become a lot more distressing for us.
<h4>Distressing? Why?</h4>
Below the surface lies our old human habit of appearing to others as we wish to appear, which for most of us involves hiding some elements and sometimes lying about others. We are weak, boring, average, struggling and unhappy, but we wish to appear strong, interesting, exceptional, successful and happy ; and there are few, if any, whom we trust to see our real selves. Maybe the would would be a better place if everyone was fully honest with others — no secrets, no lies, just sincere honesty — but that is not how we are, and uncontrolled publicization of information about ourselves will make many of us unhappy.
<h4>But those are faceless corporations sifting through my data with automated tools. Even if they could judge me, I wouldn't care.</h4>
You need health insurance, but the insurance tells you that since you buy medicine far more often than the average citizen — it's right there on your credit card transaction history — there must be something wrong with your health, so you will need to pay more. And you spend a few hours explaining that the medicine was for an ailing family member, not yourself.

A prospective employer determines that because you did or said something silly back in college, you should not be hired, but never explains why you were rejected.

You are divorcing, and your spouse's lawyer digs up some innocent information from your cell phone or internet history which, out of context, makes you look extremely bad.

Even faceless organizations can judge you based on information. In fact, they would rather collect and buy as much information as possible about you, because they assume that you would lie about it.
<h4>Wait, wait, wait. You're assuming that my insurance company could find out about my credit card history.</h4>
Yes, I am assuming that, and I know it sounds like paranoia. But there are evil people out there who see those huge databases full of tasty personal information and will try to get their hands of them. This has already happened.

Hackers regularly attack web sites and <a href="http://news.cnet.com/8301-10797_3-20058070-235/sonys-hacking-woes-mount-after-psn-breach-roundup/" target="_blank">extract personal information from their databases</a>.
<blockquote>It started as a security breach on the PlayStation network and other Sony services that exposed the personal information of 100 million users. From there, it has mushroomed into broader, ongoing security troubles across the Sony empire that have spilled out into the wider world.</blockquote>
Lawyers have <a href="https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2011/09/judge-sanctions-copyright-troll-attorney" target="_blank">used the courts' power to subpoena</a> ISPs for personal information of potential offenders, without the courts' consent.
<blockquote>To summarize the staggering chutzpah involved in this case: Stone asked the Court to authorize sending subpoenas to the ISPs. The Court said “not yet.” Stone sent the subpoenas anyway.</blockquote>
Recently, the German government <a href="http://redtape.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2011/10/11/8274668-german-officials-admit-using-spyware-on-citizens-as-big-brother-scandal-grows" target="_blank">used trojans to extract communication information</a> present on computers.
<blockquote>[...] the German-based Chaos Computer Club announced it had examined a Trojan horse program allegedly spread by government officials to secretly spy on citizens' Internet travels, e-mail, chat and more. The software, originally intended only to help officials intercept Internet phone calls through legal wiretaps, went far beyond those permissible purposes, the hacker group alleged.</blockquote>
Individuals, corporations, governments, everyone has done it and will probably do it again at some point. Just because something is illegal or forbidden does not mean it will not happen. Nor does it mean that laws cannot be later adapted or extended to allow previously forbidden behavior.

<strong>I do not trust groups of humans to act in a responsible and independent manner</strong>. If the underlying principles of a technology makes invasions of privacy impossible or very difficult, I will feel safe and secure. If the only guarantee is a promise, however strong or binding it may appear, then I might as well assume that there is no privacy.
<h4>What if they guarantee that there is no personally identifiable information collected ?</h4>
That is usually a promise — an intentional anonymization process that could be removed at a later point. But even assuming that they are honest and will remain forever honest, « personally identifiable » is hardly a concrete property of information. If you are the only person in your ZIP code born on a specific day, then <strong>ZIP code + birth date is a personally identifiable information about you</strong>. And indeed, 87% of the US population can be identified <a href="http://latanyasweeney.org/work/identifiability.html" target="_blank">using only their ZIP code, birth date and gender</a>.

Your facebook browsing history, never mentions your identity, but I can guess you who you are based on which Facebook profile you visit the most — yours — using a simple frequency analysis algorithm.

<strong>The only way to make sure that no personally identifiable data is stored is to make sure that it is deleted</strong>.
